## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew**, and I offer software development and database administration services as an independent consultant.

I specialize in **backend development**, writing Ruby 💎 code with **Ruby on Rails** and **Active Record**, and SQL, shell scripts, and more with **PostgreSQL** 🐘 databases.

## Why hire me?
- Hire me to improve the performance of your queries, and avoid the need to scale vertically
- Hire me to reduce the data-related bugs and incidents your team is facing, so they can focus on building your core products
- Hire me to evaluate your current schema designs, queries, indexes, and instances, to improve reliability, cost efficiency, or prepare for growth.
- You may be facing a significant data migration, and that's something I can help you with.
- You may need the services of an application-focused DBA, who can provide and apply recommendations for both PostgreSQL and Rails. I can do that.
- Would your team benefit from more PostgreSQL and database topic training? I can provide customized training on PostgreSQL topics for your team. 🧠

Something else? Let’s talk (see below).
