## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew**, and I offer software development and database services as an independent consultant.

I specialize in **backend development** in Ruby 💎 with **Ruby on Rails**, SQL, shell scripts, and optimized **PostgreSQL** 🐘 databases.

## Why hire me?
I've worked on multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases, used by Rails apps running thousands of queries per second. I even [wrote a book about it](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/).

I want to help your engineering team solve their database and application problems, using practical solutions we'll implement together.

📊 We can improve the performance of your queries, avoiding the costs of more expensive server instances<br/>
🐛 We can reduce data-related bugs in your application, adding more time back for your team to focus on product development<br/>
💾 We can evaluate your schema, queries, and indexes, and design a plan that improves their reliability, cost efficiency, and growth management<br/>
🐘 If you're facing a challenging data migration due to a *primary key conversion* or *partitioned table migration*, I can help.<br/>
👨 If your team would benefit from training on database and PostgreSQL topics, I'd be happy to design some educational talks that fit in your team's needs and schedule.<br/>

If you're not seeing something here you'd hoped to see, [contact me](/contact) and let's chat.
