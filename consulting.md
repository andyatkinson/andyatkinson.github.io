## Hi 👋
I’m **Andrew**, and I'd love to help you with your **PostgreSQL** 🐘 databases and **Ruby on Rails** 💎 web applications.

## Why work with me?

I've optimized multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases running thousands of queries per second. I understand the kinds of challenges faced at that scale.

I love working with teams and providing educational material. I wrote a bestselling book [**High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails**](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/), published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024, to help more engineers acquire these skills.

## What will we work on?

📊 We can **improve query performance**, helping avoid unnecessary spending on larger instances<br/>
💾 Let's optimize the schema design, queries, and indexes, for greater reliability and performance<br/>
🐘 I'll perform **data migrations** for *primary key conversions* or *partitioned table migrations*, based on a plan we'll review together in advance<br/>
👨 As a [conference presenter](/speaking-opportunities) and educator, I'm ready to train your team on PostgreSQL and Active Record topics. We can use existing materials or create a custom plan.<br/>
