## Hi üëã
Andrew Atkinson Consulting ([Refined Pages, LLC](https://refinedpages.com)), provides software engineering design and optimization services for startups.

We specialize in helping startups and mid-sized companies scale their PostgreSQL databases and web application platforms, without costly rewrites.

By increasing the performance, reliability, efficiency of their systems, startups maximize their infrastructure spend, avoid costly downtime incidents, and deliver great user experiences, providing predictable revenue and user expansion.

## Why work with me?
I've optimized multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases running thousands of queries per second, removing unnecessary data, improving visibility into the operations, and I'm eager to bring this experience to your company's platform.

I've written a bestselling book [*High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails*](/pgrailsbook) (Pragmatic Programmers 2024) to help backend engineers learn how to better operate high performance PostgreSQL backed web applications.

## What will we work on?
First we'll create an assessment of the data and operational health of your system. We'll identify opportunities to improve performance, observability, and reliability, and reduce cost.

üìä Problematic queries with high latency<br/>
üíæ Unneeded data removal and optimizations for the schema, query, and indexes<br/>
üêò Online data migrations, backfills, and transformations for efficiency and growth management<br/>
üë® Training and support for the full-time team members on PostgreSQL, SQL, and Active Record<br/>
üîé Improved operational visibility and optimized tunable parameter values


## Recommendations ü§ù
> Andrew helped us tune PostgreSQL parameters, build our multi-database integration, and optimize queries.
<cite>- Brendan, VP of Engineering</cite>

> Working with Andy was super easy and very helpful. I got a deep insight into how Postgres works for the specific problem we were looking at, and what solutions we could implement.
<cite>Sameer, CTO, [Canopy Analytics](https://www.canopyanalytics.com)</cite>

> I wanted to fill some knowledge gaps on the team around some Postgres topics. Andrew's book was the first thing we reached for but we also brought him in to deliver two sessions of live training on some advanced topics. This gave us the opportunity to ask questions, delve deeper, and ensure everyone understood the material.
<cite>Jamie, CTO, [Podia](https://www.podia.com)</cite>

> We hired Andrew to help us better understand the PostgreSQL database operations for our Rails apps. Andrew helped us look at a variety of issues and provided guidance and recommendations.
<cite>- Kevin, CTO, [Clearscope](https://www.clearscope.io)</cite>

> Andrew provided our team with training on query plans and indexes, then rewrote an important query, greatly improving the performance.
<cite>- John, Director of Engineering</cite>
