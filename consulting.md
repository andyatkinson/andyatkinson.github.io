## Hi 👋
I’m **Andrew**, and I'd love to help you with your 🐘 **PostgreSQL** databases and 💎 **Ruby on Rails** web applications.

## Why work with me?

I've optimized multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases running thousands of queries per second. I understand the kinds of challenges faced at that scale.

I love working with teams and providing educational content. I wrote a bestselling book [*High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails*](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/) published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024, to help more engineers learn these skills.

## What will we work on?

📊 We can **improve query performance**, helping avoid unnecessary spending on larger instances<br/>
💾 Let's optimize the schema design, queries, and indexes, for greater reliability and performance<br/>
🐘 I'll perform **data migrations** for *primary key conversions* or *partitioned table migrations*, based on a plan we'll review together in advance<br/>
👨 As a [conference presenter](/speaking-opportunities) and educator, I'm ready to train your team on PostgreSQL and Active Record topics. We can use existing materials or create a custom plan.<br/>


## Recommendations 🤝
> Working with Andy was super easy and very helpful. I got a deep insight into how Postgres works for the specific problem we were looking at, and what solutions we could implement.
<cite>Sameer, CTO, [Canopy Analytics](https://www.canopyanalytics.com)</cite>

> I wanted to fill some knowledge gaps on the team around some Postgres topics. Andrew's book was the first thing we reached for but we also brought him in to deliver two sessions of live training on some advanced topics. This gave us the opportunity to ask questions, delve deeper, and ensure everyone understood the material.
<cite>Jamie, CTO, [Podia](https://www.podia.com)</cite>

> We hired Andrew to help us better understand the PostgreSQL database operations for our Rails apps. Andrew helped us look at a variety of issues and provided guidance and recommendations.
<cite>- Kevin, CTO, [Clearscope](https://www.clearscope.io)</cite>

> Andrew helped us tune PostgreSQL parameters, build our multi-database integration, and optimize queries.
<cite>- Brendan, VP of Engineering</cite>

> Andrew provided our team with training on query plans and indexes, then rewrote an important query, greatly improving the performance.
<cite>- John, Director of Engineering</cite>
