## Hello 👋
Hi, I’m **Andrew**, and I'm ready to help you solve your **PostgreSQL** 🐘 database and **Ruby on Rails** 💎 web application challenges as an independent consultant.

## Why hire me?
I've worked on multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases with Rails apps performing thousands of queries per second. I love working on database performance challenges, and even [wrote a book about High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/).

📊 Let's **improve your database query performance**, avoiding costly vertical scaling<br/>
🐛 Let's eliminate data-related bugs, avoiding distractions<br/>
💾 Let's evaluate your schema design, queries, and indexes, based on your reliability and performance goals<br/>
🐘 I'll perform challenging **data migrations** as required for *primary key conversion*, a *partitioned table migration*, or low downtime cutovers.<br/>
👨 I'll happily provide training for your team on PostgreSQL and Rails topics, with off-the-shelf **training presentations** or custom ones (See Below).<br/>
