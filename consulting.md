## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew** (or **Andy**). I offer software development and database consulting to teams.

I specialize in **backend development** with **Ruby on Rails** and database operations with **PostgreSQL** 🐘. I am most enthusiastic about fixing database performance problems for teams to help them improve the scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency of their web applications.

## Why hire me?
- Hire me to help improve the performance of your existing queries, in order to avoid needing to scale your instances.
- Hire me to reduce the number of data-related bugs and incidents your team is facing, so they can stay more focused on building the product.
- Hire me to evaluate your current schema design and instances based on your current data size and query volume, and future growth plans. We can discuss changes and I can perform any necessary data migrations.
- Hire me as a partial application-focused DBA for your team, who can provide recommendations and insights for PostgreSQL, as well as code changes in Ruby within the flow of your team development practices.
- Hire me to provide training on database topics to your full-time Rails team members. 🧠
- Something else not mentioned here? Let’s chat (see below).


## Testimonials 🤝
> Andrew helped us test and apply PostgreSQL parameters that reduced errors. Andrew is now contributing to our multiple databases strategy with Rails to improve our platform resiliency.
<cite>- VP of Engineering</cite>


> Andrew provided training to our team on reading query plans and designing indexes. Andrew rewrote a complex query and added indexes to greatly improve performance.
<cite>- Director of Engineering</cite>


## Rates
As a U.S.-based Staff-level Rails engineer, I’m offering my services at a competitive market rate. Since you’re hiring me on a partial basis, you’ll pay a fraction of what you’d pay to hire a full-time engineer with comparable skills.

Instead of straight hourly pricing, let’s consider the scope of work you need, and a rough timeline and deliverables. We’ll make a plan together, add a price, and I’ll track my hours. Besides daily communication when work is happening, you’ll get detailed invoices.

## How does it work?
1. We’ll have a **30 minute no-cost, no-obligation call** over Zoom or Hangouts. I recommend having someone attend that’s authorized to hire contractors, and someone that’s hands-on in the codebase and databases.
1. We’ll discuss the challenges you’re facing and what your goals are. I’ll take notes and start preparing a plan.
1. Once we’ve reviewed the plan, we’ll discuss goals, deliverables, and an overall fee. We’ll get it all in writing, sign the legal documents, and get to work.



## Let's talk

I’m looking forward to working with you! Please [contact me](/contact) and put "Consulting" in the subject line.

Thank you for your consideration!

<summary>My Qualifications</summary>
<p>
By hiring me, your team could shave off months or years of time spent learning, by leveraging my experience with PostgreSQL and Rails.
</p>

  <ul>
<li>More than 12 years of professional Ruby on Rails experience as a full-time employee (FTE) individual contributor (IC) engineer, most recently at a Staff level (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyatkinson/">LinkedIn profile</a>), at Microsoft, Groupon, LivingSocial, and Fountain.</li>

<details>
<summary>Technical leadership of database operations</summary>
<p>I’ve <a href="/blog/2023/08/17/postgresql-sfpug-table-partitioning-presentation">performed zero downtime online migrations of multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases</a>, managing more than ten instances, and tables with billions of rows. I’ve used zero-downtime cutover techniques like dual writes, to perform application-level sharding for load distribution.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on a Rails app serving 7500 requests/second (450K RPM) at an average response rate of 35ms. I’ve <a href="/blog/2023/08/28/saas-for-developers-gwen-shapira-postgresql-rails">spoken about this experience</a> and presented on it at <a href="/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021">PGConf NYC 2021</a>.</p>
