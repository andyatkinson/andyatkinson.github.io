## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew**, and I offer software development and database administration services as an independent consultant.

I specialize in **backend development**, writing Ruby 💎 code with **Ruby on Rails** and **Active Record**, and SQL, shell scripts, and more with **PostgreSQL** 🐘 databases.

## Why hire me?
I'm comfortable working with multi-terabyte databases and thousands of queries per second, particularly with [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/rds). I [wrote a book about it](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/).

- Hire me to improve the performance of your queries, to avoid needing to scale instances vertically
- Hire me to reduce your data-related bugs and incidents, so your full-time team can focus on your core products
- Hire me to evaluate your schema design, queries, indexes, and instances, to improve their reliability, cost efficiency, and growth management
- If you're facing a significant data migration, perhaps due to a schema change (primary key conversion, table partitioning), I can help.
- I can provide you Application DBA insights and recommendations for both PostgreSQL and Rails, and apply changes for parameters and code
- Would your team benefit from PostgreSQL training on index design or query planning? I would be happy to do that. 🧠

Something else? Let’s talk (see below).
