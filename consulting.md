## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew**, and I offer software development and database services as an independent consultant.

I specialize in **backend development**, writing Ruby 💎 code with **Ruby on Rails** and **Active Record**, and SQL, shell scripts, and technical operations for **PostgreSQL** 🐘 databases.

## Why hire me?
I've worked on multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases, used by Rails apps running thousands of queries per second. I even [wrote a book about it](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/).

- Hire me to improve the performance of your queries, which could help you avoid costs from scaling instances vertically
- Hire me to reduce data-related bugs and incidents, providing more time for your team to focus on core product development
- Hire me to evaluate your schema design, queries, and indexes, to improve their reliability, cost efficiency, and better manage growth
- If you're facing a significant data migration, perhaps a primary key conversion or partitioned table migration, I can help.
- Would your team benefit from PostgreSQL training on index design or query planning? I would be happy to do that. 🧠

Not seeing something here you wondered about? Book a time below or [contact me](/contact).
