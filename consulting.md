## Hi 👋
I’m **Andrew**, and I'd love to help you with your 🐘 **PostgreSQL** databases and 💎 **Ruby on Rails** web applications.

## Why work with me?

I've optimized multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases running thousands of queries per second. I've worked with PostgreSQL in various forms mostly via AWS, but also on GCP, Heroku, and self-hosted.

I wrote a bestselling book [*High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails*](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/) published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024 to help backend engineers learn these skills.

## What will we work on?

We'll work on an assessment of your system, identifying opportunities to improve performance, reduce cost, and improve reliability.

📊 Identify problematic queries and improve their performance and efficiency<br/>
💾 Optimize your schema, query, and index designs for space and cost reduction<br/>
🐘 Perform data migrations, backfills, or partitioned table migrations as needed based on performance goals<br/>
👨 Provide mentoring and guidance for your team on PostgreSQL, SQL, database devops, and Active Record topics.<br/>
🔎 Improve the observability, metrics, and alerts for your system, to help empower the engineers


## Recommendations 🤝
> Working with Andy was super easy and very helpful. I got a deep insight into how Postgres works for the specific problem we were looking at, and what solutions we could implement.
<cite>Sameer, CTO, [Canopy Analytics](https://www.canopyanalytics.com)</cite>

> I wanted to fill some knowledge gaps on the team around some Postgres topics. Andrew's book was the first thing we reached for but we also brought him in to deliver two sessions of live training on some advanced topics. This gave us the opportunity to ask questions, delve deeper, and ensure everyone understood the material.
<cite>Jamie, CTO, [Podia](https://www.podia.com)</cite>

> We hired Andrew to help us better understand the PostgreSQL database operations for our Rails apps. Andrew helped us look at a variety of issues and provided guidance and recommendations.
<cite>- Kevin, CTO, [Clearscope](https://www.clearscope.io)</cite>

> Andrew helped us tune PostgreSQL parameters, build our multi-database integration, and optimize queries.
<cite>- Brendan, VP of Engineering</cite>

> Andrew provided our team with training on query plans and indexes, then rewrote an important query, greatly improving the performance.
<cite>- John, Director of Engineering</cite>
