## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew**, and I offer software development and database administration services as an independent consultant.

I specialize in **backend development** with **Ruby on Rails** and database operations with **PostgreSQL**. 🐘

## Why hire me?
- Hire me to improve the performance of your existing queries, helping you avoid the need to vertically scale your instances.
- Hire me to reduce the number of data-related bugs and incidents your team is facing, so they can stay focused on building the product.
- Hire me to evaluate your current schema, queries, indexes, and instances relative to your future growth plans. For any changes, I can perform the data migrations without downtime, to arrive at a more optimal design.
- Hire me as an application-focused DBA for your team, who can provide and apply recommendations and insights for both PostgreSQL and Ruby application code.
- Hire me to provide training for your Rails team on PostgreSQL database topics. 🧠
- Something not mentioned here? Let’s talk (see below).
