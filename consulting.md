## Hello 👋 
I’m **Andrew** (or **Andy**), and I offer software development and database consulting.

I specialize in **backend development** with **Ruby on Rails** and database operations with **PostgreSQL** 🐘. I love fixing database performance problems to increase the scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency of web applications.

## Why hire me?
- To get better performance, you’re considering scaling your instances, but wondering if your existing queries could be improved instead.
- You might have a lot of data-related bugs or incidents, and want to reduce those to allow your team to focus more.
- You may be experiencing or expecting big data growth, and wondering whether your current schema design and instances are equipped to handle it.
- Without a dedicated DBA or DB-focused senior engineer on your team, you may be wondering how to grow a broad base of database skills on your team, without locking up your valuable full-time team members. 🧠


## Testimonials 🤝
> Andrew helped us test and apply PostgreSQL parameter changes to reduce errors on large tables. Andrew is now contributing to our implementation of Rails’ multiple databases to improve our platform resiliency.
<cite>- VP of Engineering</cite>


> Andrew provided training to our team on query plans and index design. Without making schema changes, Andrew rewrote the query and added indexes to greatly improve the performance.
<cite>- Director of Engineering</cite>


## Rates
As a U.S.-based Staff-level Rails engineer, I’m offering my services at a competitive rate within the market. Since you’re hiring me on a partial basis, you’ll pay a fraction of what you’d pay to hire an engineer with comparable skills on a full-time basis.

We’ll agree on a scope of work with deliverables. You’ll have a rough idea of how long the work will take. I’ll track my hours and send you invoices based on the plan.

## How does it work?
1. We’ll have a **30 minute no-cost, no-obligation call** over Zoom or Hangouts. I recommend a couple of people on your side, including someone authorized to hire contractors, and someone who works hands-on in the codebase.
1. We’ll discuss the challenges you’re facing and your goals. I’ll take notes and begin preparing a plan.
1. With the rough plan shared, we’ll determine the goals, deliverables, and a fee. We’ll get it all in writing along with legal documents.
1. With all the documents signed, we’ll get to work.



## Let's talk

I’m looking forward to working with you! Please [contact me](/contact) and put "Consulting" in the subject line.

Thank you for your consideration!

<summary>My Qualifications</summary>
<p>
By hiring me, your team could shave off months or years of time spent learning, by leveraging my experience with PostgreSQL and Rails.
</p>

  <ul>
<li>More than 12 years of professional Ruby on Rails experience as a full-time employee (FTE) individual contributor (IC) engineer, most recently at a Staff level (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyatkinson/">LinkedIn profile</a>), at Microsoft, Groupon, LivingSocial, and Fountain.</li>

<details>
<summary>Technical leadership of database operations</summary>
<p>I’ve <a href="/blog/2023/08/17/postgresql-sfpug-table-partitioning-presentation">performed zero downtime online migrations of multi-terabyte PostgreSQL databases</a>, managing more than ten instances, and tables with billions of rows.

<p>I’ve worked on a Rails app serving 7500 requests/second (450K RPM) at an average response rate of 35ms. I’ve <a href="/blog/2023/08/28/saas-for-developers-gwen-shapira-postgresql-rails">spoken about this experience</a> and presented on it at <a href="/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021">PGConf NYC 2021</a>.</p>
