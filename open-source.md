From 2009-2013 I created and maintained two apps in the iOS App Store, related to public transit. These apps provided train and bus schedule information for riders.

After abandoning plans to turn these apps into a business, I open sourced the code.

[TrainBrain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/TrainBrain) and [BusBrain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/BusBrain).
