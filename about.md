#### Nerd Origin Story

My family was privileged to have a IBM PCjr in our house in the 1980s, a Prodigy Internet connection and 14.4kbps modem by the early 1990s.

Although I mostly played games and assembled gaming computers as a teen, eventually I discovered programming in college. I became hooked on building web sites, applications, mobile apps and more, and continue to be!
