#### Summary

As a Staff Software Engineer at [Fountain](https://get.fountain.com/), I build and support back-end systems using open source tools like Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch.

Outside of [writing and reviewing code](https://github.com/andyatkinson/), I conduct code screens, interviews, and onboard and mentor team members.

To improve overall engineering I write documentation, change logs, code review checklists and help to support existing patterns and create new ones.

#### Education

Andy earned Bachelors degrees from the [University of Minnesota](http://umn.edu) in Minneapolis, MN. He completed one semester abroad at the Fundación José Ortega y Gasset in Toledo, Spain.

  * Bachelor of Applied Science in Information Technology Infrastructure
  * Bachelor of Arts in Spanish Studies

#### Personal Life

Outside of technology and spending time with his family and friends, he enjoys running, cycling, travel, and following the perpetually struggling Timberwolves NBA basketball team.

#### Recommendations

 > In short, I cannot recommend Andy highly enough for an engineering position at your company. His communication skills, candor, and thoughtfulness will bring tremendous value to any company that he joins.

#### Nerd Origin Story

My family was privileged to have a IBM PCjr in our house in the 1980s, a Prodigy Internet connection and 14.4kbps modem by the early 1990s.

Although I mostly played games and assembled gaming computers as a teen, eventually I discovered programming in college. I became hooked on building web sites, applications, mobile apps and more, and continue to be!
