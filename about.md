#### Origin Story

I was a computer nerd from my early days, thanks in part to early exposure to computers. My family was privileged to have a IBM PCjr in our house in the 1980s and a Prodigy Internet connection with a 14.4kbps modem by the early 1990s.

Although my computer time was mostly playing games and building gaming computers as a kid, eventually I found programming and became hooked on being able to build things and distribute them over the Internet.
