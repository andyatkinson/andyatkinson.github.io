Edward Tufte is a statistician and considered an expert on presenting data visually. Tufte was highly recommended, so I decided to attend his 1-day course in Minneapolis. Part of the event cost included four of Tufte's books as hardcovers. 

Tufte presented to a room of hundreds the the day I attended, and there was another day scheduled with hundreds more! I enjoyed the course and met him briefly at the end to get a book autographed.

My notes:

 - presentations should be problem-driven, use "whatever it takes" to show data
 - annotate nouns (in handouts)
 - provide "reasons to believe"
 - alternative explanations "must compete" 
 - put nouns into context
 - find the "supergraphic" of your field
 - celebrate the fact that viewers of the handout accompanying your presentation are reading ahead
 - "information overload is a failure of design"
 - "genuine interaction" means evoking different memories for each user
 - bring something for your presentation that's "real" (hospital bill example), note: "real means tangible"
 - order by performance, not alphabetically, when you find the "performance data"
 - don't design to the lowest common denominator
 - gill sans font for tables, 1-pg. 750 words
 - provoke interest and curiosity beyond the moment
 - Nature magazine was used as an example of great design, it has dense high quality information
 - work hard on performance data (performance data is most important)
 - "tone deaf" to the audience
 - get information adjacent in space, not "stacked in time"
 - don't use "flatland" to describe high-dimensional problems
 - what's the rate of information throughput?
 - "improvements in resolution"
 - "direct labeling"--eliminate legends and codes etc. from chart elements as much as possible
 - bring a real 3-dimensional object to your presentation, escape flatland
 - don't segregate information by the "mode of production"
 - "compared with what", grand comparisons
 - deep knowledge and caring about the content
 - "design cannot rescue failed content" (content is most important)
 - "do no harm" to content (note: presentation should not harm content)
 - do things adjacent in space
 - use small multiples (natural comparisons), easy on the viewer
 - take advantage of viewer's investment in learning the format
 - avoid "de-quantification"
 - "chartoonist" (note: derogatory term for charts that look like cartoons)
 - PowerPoint presentations are a "dominance relationship", the "dreaded slow reveal" (note: advocates having handouts and encouraging users to read ahead, not conform to presenter's slide reveal speed)
 - turning cognitive tasks into design principles
 - principles help to be a smarter consumer
 - "interface indifference"
 - screen + paper, more cooperation, interface neutrality, "whatever it takes"
 - 90% of the screen has content, information throughput
 - "we don't have to attract them, they've already arrived."
 - avoid bureaucracy of organization in design "conway's law"
 - "outside-in" design
 - "solutions looking for a problem to solve"
 - insist on high resolution from the start
 - administrative debris
 - word-size graphics (note: these are sparklines)
 - typographic resolution not cartoon resolution
 - sparklines: part of text, not separate
 - too much weight to recency, "recency bias", sparklines do not emphasize recency, shows more data
 - design driven by cognitive task, choose graph resolution appropriate to problem
 - wave fields (note: new chart style Tufte is experimenting with)
 - PowerPoint "projector operating system", 50-250 slides fit on A3/11x17, begin with a serious summary
   1. problem (issue)
   2. why do I care (relevance)
   3. solution
 - 4-page handout, note: one sheet, double-side printed, folded
 - people talk 140-150 words per minute, attendees can read faster than that!
 - "high resolution data dump", 12 professors reading information-dense handouts
 - sentences have "causal agency"
 - get better content!
 - rehearse your presentation, listen to video and audio
 - room setup: try to get control, let audience see gestures
 - in a long room? stand on the broad side, more of the audience is engaged
 - ask a colleague to ask questions as an audience member, get the audience rolling
 - "mastering the techniques of teaching" - show up early!
 - see how long you can stay out of first person singular
 - finish early!
 

I enjoyed the Tufte set of talks and recommend seeing him if you get the chance!
