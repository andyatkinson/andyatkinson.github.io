Today I'm attending the inaugural [Twin Cities Code Camp](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx), a free conference with sessions on .NET, testing, Ajax, and web services. Here are summaries of the morning sessions I attended.

##### Object/Relational Mapping with Hibernate

Bob McCune gave an introduction to [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/). He showed live code of Hibernate API calls and the SQL that was produced. Hibernate provides relational database independence and maps Java objects to the rows in relational databases.

##### Quick and Dirty Functional Testing with Selenium
Steve Peterson gave an excellent introduction to an open source tool called [Selenium](http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/). He created and ran test scripts created with the Selenium IDE (a Firefox addon). The tool allowed him to capture input and view the results in a graphical way or in a source code view. The source code view can be toggled to output results in languages like Java, Ruby, or .NET. Output viewed as Java can be copied and pasted into a JUnit test.

##### Building Innovative Applications using Amazon Web Services
Jinesh Varia gave us an overview of all the [Amazon web services](http://aws.amazon.com/), then focused on specific code examples utilizing Simple Storage Service (S3) and the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Twin Cities code camp had some great sessions. I enjoyed meeting people and hope to attend again in the future.
