Today I'm attending the inaugural [Twin Cities Code Camp](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx), a free conference with varied sessions on .NET, test tooling, Ajax, web services, and more. The venue is new, meeting rooms are labeled well, and the event staff is professional and courteous. Sponsors are providing great food and great prizes will be given away at the end of the day. Here are summaries of the morning sessions I attended.

Object/Relational Mapping with Hibernate
---
Bob McCune gave an excellent introduction to [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/). He showed live code of easy-to-understand Hibernate API calls and the SQL that was produced. Hibernate provides relational database independence, and helps map plain Java objects to the relational database structure.

Quick and Dirty Functional Testing with Selenium
----
Steve Peterson gave an excellent introduction to an open source tool called [Selenium](http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/). He created and ran test scripts created with the Selenium IDE (a Firefox addon). The tool allowed him to capture input and view the results in a graphical way or in a source code view. The source code view can be toggled to output capture results in many languages like Java, Ruby, or .NET languages. Output viewed as Java can be copied and pasted into a JUnit test method.

Building Innovative Applications using Amazon Web Services
---
Jinesh Varia gave us an overview of all the [Amazon web services](http://aws.amazon.com/), then focused on specific code examples utilizing Simple Storage Service (S3) and the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Twin Cities code camp has some great sessions, especially for a free event. I enjoyed meeting people as well and hope to attend again in the future.
