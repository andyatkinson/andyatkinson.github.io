Back in November, I met with Claire Giordano, host of the Talking Postgres podcast, who asked a ton of great questions about my experience writing a Postgres book aimed at Ruby on Rails web developers.

## Some questions
Claire had a lot of thoughtful questions. Here's a few:

- Why write a technical book? Was there some moment or spark?
- Why write a book about Postgres?
- Why Ruby on Rails?

## Fun topics
Claire also brought up a lot of fun points and reactions. Here's a sample:

- The importance planting seeds and encouraging others with ambitious projects
- Would I consider writing a book for Django and Python for Postgres?
- Where does the book fit in the landscape?
- How long did it take to write this book?
- Did I ever want to quit writing, even for a moment?
- Did I have a party when the book was fully complete?
- I talked about "little parties" with Rails developer communities at events like Rails World and Sin City Ruby
- What was my experience like in working with other publishers
- I shared my deep appreciation for the efforts of the technical reviewers of the book!
- We talked about cheese! 🧀 (stories and connections with Postgres icons David Rowley and Melanie Plageman)
- What was my favorite chapter?
- Is there a frequently asked question I get about databases from Rails developers?
- For my consulting services, do clients hire me for my Rails expertise or my Postgres expertise?
