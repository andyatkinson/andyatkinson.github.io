I attended RailsConf for my first time, held in Baltimore, MD this year. It was especially exciting as we just relocated to Baltimore literally 2 days prior to RailsConf after a long drive from Minneapolis. Apart from the great sessions, I was also able to meet some great people like Ryan Bates and John Nunemaker who have produced lots of great content and code I've used over the last 2.5 years I've been working with Rails. The lunches were another great way to meet people as well as bars/restaurants after the daytime sessions.

Sunday: Lightning talks, great.

[8 Steps to open source software development](http://oss-8steps.heroku.com) with Dr. Nic.: this was my second time seeing Dr. Nic, after the lightning talk Karaoke round Sunday night. He had good tips. We worked on a project by forking it and adding some development instructions.

 * github gem
