I attended RailsConf in Baltimore, MD this year. It was especially exciting as we had just relocated to Baltimore 2 days earlier after a long drive from Minneapolis.

Apart from the great sessions, I was able to meet some great people from the Ruby community like Ryan Bates and John Nunemaker.

Sunday: Lightning talks, great.

[8 Steps to open source software development](http://oss-8steps.heroku.com) with Dr. Nic. This was my second time seeing Dr. Nic, after the lightning talk Karaoke round Sunday night.

He had good tips. We worked on a project by forking it and adding some development instructions.

* Check GitHub issues
* Ruby toolbox
* GitHub gem
* Fork queue (check this and merge some forks in)
