Hi Folks. Quick post here on some thoughts from Day 1 of AWS re:Invent.

This event is absolutely massive and overwhelming. While it makes sense to create a plan in advance, it's likely that even well-formed plans may crumble due to the scale of the event. Sessions can be reserved, but even 2 weeks in advance, the sessions I wanted to reserve were mostly filled.

* Walking in Vegas is difficult. I walked to Caesar’s Forum from Park MGM and it wasn't great. Next time I'll take the Monorail or the shuttles. Staying on the North end of the Strip is probably most convenient, with Venetian and Caesar's Forum over here.
* I tried to attend 2 sessions by Walk-In at Caesar’s Forum, arriving 15 minutes in advance, an Aurora Serverless V2 session. Unfortunately there were around 50-60 people for about 20 slots and I was sent packing.
* Tried to power walk across the entire Forum venue (well past 10k steps today) for a Security session. Unfortunately, same scenario, too popular, closed to walk-ins.
* At Lunch, [Franck Pachot](https://twitter.com/FranckPachot) of [Yugabyte](https://www.yugabyte.com) and I coordinated a meetup. I'm a big fan of Franck's distributed databases educational content. Very cool to meet him!
* After lunch, I attended a session on the architecture for Dow Jones, their S&P 500 and their Down Jones Industrial Average. The talk was focused more on the database architecture with Aurora. I found it to be very informative as a case study on how they undertook a large scale migration of a 15TB database, minimizing their migration time.
* Later I attended a "quiet" talk via video feed and with headphones, and 50 of my fellow attendees. Given by the Braze CTO on their journey from being a SaaS startup to a public company, on their preparedness. This talk was really done, highly detailed for a technical audience, but also highly detailed on processes, financial health, cost drivers, focused on high margins. Tons to dig into here later.

I’m now in the Expo Hall which is absolutely massive.

As I’m writing this, I’m charging my phone. The Forum venue has outlets, coffee everywhere, and is staffed really well. The wi-fi works everywhere. Although I’d recommend a small battery pack!

That’s all for Day 1!
