Tonight I attended my first meeting of the monthly [B'more on Rails](http://bmoreonrails.org/) User Group, having recently relocated from Minneapolis to Baltimore. In addition to the monthly technical talk, there are nights planned just for socializing, and others planned just for open source hacking. 

Separating the socializing and coding nights seems like a great idea. The monthly technical meetup has introductions and job hiring/seeking opportunities to start things off, then 1-2 lightning talks, followed by the main talk. Lightning talks are often just enough time to introduce an open source project or tool. 

Brian Cardarella presented a client-side validation plugin, which generates validations from Rails model code with jQuery. Chris Cahoon introduced Haml, Sass, and Compass. Afterwards group members talked about these tools, microformats, css, working with designers, and more. I have been working with these tools for over a year but picked up some new tips, thanks guys! Looking forward to attending more events.
