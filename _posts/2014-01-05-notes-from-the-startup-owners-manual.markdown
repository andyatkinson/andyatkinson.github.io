The book **_The Startup Owner's Manual_** [^book] has a lot of practical tips to increase the chances of success at your startup. Here are some notes from Chapters 4 and 5 from the book.

## Questions to ask
* Have we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?
* Does our product solve this problem?
* Do we have a viable and profitable business model?
* Have we learned enough to go out and sell?
* What do I want to learn? What is the simplest pass/fail test I can design to test this?

## Concepts
* Develop the product for the few, not the many.
* Find the *earlyvangelists* (sic). Earlyvangelists are willing to pay for the product. The buying process can be tested with the earlyvangelists.
* Look for people solving the problem with a homegrown solution.
* After developing the MVP features, delay new features until the MVP features are not attracting new customers.
* Gather a massive and growing audience efficiently and cost-effectively.
* Become #1 in something: product attribute, territory, distribution channel/retailer, or customer base.
* Segment the market: age, income, or region.
* Winners understand why customers buy.
* [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) referrals usually $12/referral.
* [grants.gov](http://www.grants.gov/) worth investigating.
* Provisional patents are good for 1 year and cheap relative to the 20-50k patent price.
* On "get out of the building" (and talk to customers): Don't confuse motion with action. It takes a lot of meetings to generate a few meaningful conversations.
