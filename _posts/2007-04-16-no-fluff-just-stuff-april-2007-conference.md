I attended the April 2007 Minneapolis stop of the [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com) Java symposium with a few coworkers. The keynote was how to choose a web framework (several were presented throughout the weekend). [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) (enjoyed a few presentations from David Geary including one on GWT) was a big topic as was the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) programming language and [Grails framework](http://www.grails.org/). I also enjoyed a presentation from [Ted Neward](http://tedneward.com/) on the internals of JVM garbage collection.

I hope to attend more conferences in the future. It was great to get out of the office with co-workers as well.
