I attended the [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com) Java symposium with some co-workers.

[Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) was a big topic area along with the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) programming language and [Grails framework](http://www.grails.org/). I also enjoyed a presentation from [Ted Neward](http://tedneward.com/) on the internals of JVM garbage collection.

I hope to attend more conferences in the future. It was great to get out of the office with co-workers.
