Rubyconf Argentina 2012 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at a theater in the Paseo La Plaza area. This area is in the center of Buenos Aires near the obelisk, a famous landmark. Attendees came from Buenos Aires, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and more. There were also attendees and speakers from the United States and Europe. All the [conference talks have been posted online](http://vimeo.com/album/2344729).

This was my first experience in South America. The furthest south of the United States I'd been before this was Mexico! I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to travel and give a conference talk.

Speaker day asado and talks
-------
The day before the conference, the organizers held an [asado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado) outside of the city center. An asado is kind of like a BBQ in the United States, where tons of various meats are grilled, and people are chatting, eating and drinking, mostly outside, enjoying the company and the food. This was a nice touch by the organizers, it was a great day to spend to get to know some folks better.

The following day, my talk was scheduled second. By the time I was giving the talk, I had practiced a lot, but I had never done any public speaking on an actual stage before, in front of an audience of strangers. The [Bmore on Rails](http://bmoreonrails.org/) group was nice enough to listen to a rough first version of the talk. I recommend this approach of giving the talk to a smaller group first. I under-estimated how much edit time and practice time I would need to feel comfortable, as well as making the slides look presentable.

Github sponsored a drinkup at Temple Bar in Buenos Aires, in walking distance from the conference, which was well attended. I was able to meet a lot of people.

The second day had talks in spanish and english. There was another social event at Paseo La Plaza, more casual, a nice outdoor space, to close out the conference.

Food, drink, sightseeing
------
Pizza is a big deal in Buenos Aires, at least in the downtown area, lots of places that serve it, and I saw lots of people eating it. I was able to join a bigger group and try some local pizza and it was good. At night I was also able to try the drink fernet. And of course I tried and bought some boxes of Alfajores cookies filled with Dulce de Leche to bring back for friends and family.

Sunday I did some sightseeing, on my own, armed with my camera, before my flight home Sunday night. I explored the San Telmo flea market, and the Retiro and Recoleta neighborhoods.

Giving a conference talk was a challenging experience, being able to travel internationally and meet new people made it worth doing. I learned a lot giving this talk and hope to improve as a speaker next time. I had a short stay in Buenos Aires, but I have plans to return.
