On August 8, 2023 I had the chance to present to the San Francisco Bay Area PostgreSQL User Group (SFPUG) on our case study with table partitioning with PostgreSQL.

This was the presentation "Partitioning Billions of Rows Without Downtime" I gave earlier this year at PGDay Chicago which wasn't recorded at the time.

Check out the embedded presentation below or hop over to YouTube to see it there.

I'd love to hear about any reactions you have or follow-up questions on the content.

Check out the earlier post [PGDay Chicago 2023 Conference](/blog/2023/05/24/pgday-chicago) to read about the conference experience and find a link to the slides.

Thanks!
