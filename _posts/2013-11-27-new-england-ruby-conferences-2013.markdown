I had the chance to attend two conferences this Fall in New England. 

#### Burlington Ruby Conference

[Burlington Ruby conference](http://burlingtonruby.com/) was in Burlington, VT, about 3 hours from Boston, MA. My co-worker stayed outside of downtown at an Airbnb place which worked out nicely. Burlington has some great restaurants and is a nice place to visit in the summer months. The [conference talks are online at confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/events/btvruby2013). My favorite talk was "Negotiation for Hackers" by Danielle Sucher.

#### Wicked Good Ruby Conf

[Wicked Good Ruby Conf](http://wickedgoodruby.com/2013) was held in Boston's Seaport area. I spent most of my time with some new friends I made through the Boston Ruby users group. My favorite talk from the conference was the opening keynote from Sandi Metz.

Some other conference options in the area are [Goruco](http://goruco.com/) in NY and [Nickel City Ruby](http://nickelcityruby.com/) in Buffalo, NY.
