I had the chance to attend two conferences this Fall in New England. 

Burlington Ruby Conference
---------
[Burlington Ruby conference](http://burlingtonruby.com/) happened for the second time in 2013, but it was my first time attending. Burlington, VT is a short drive from Boston, MA. I was able to attend the conference with a co-worker which was fun, we stayed outside of downtown at an Airbnb place. Burlington has some excellent restaurants and is a nice place to visit during nice weather. [Lake Champlain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain) is quite impressive. The [conference talks are online at confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/events/btvruby2013). My favorite talk was "Negotiation for Hackers" by Danielle Sucher.

Wicked Good Ruby Conf
----------------
[Wicked Good Ruby Conf](http://wickedgoodruby.com/2013) was an inaugural event held in Boston's seaport district. As a new resident of Boston, I was excited to for some colleagues and friends to be coming to Boston. I spent most of my time with some new friends I made through the Boston ruby user group. My favorite talk from the conference was the opening keynote from Sandi Metz.
