In this talk attendees will learn how Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL can be used to create scalable SaaS applications, focusing on schema and query design, and leveraging database capabilities.

Weâ€™ll define SaaS concepts, B2B, B2C, and multi-tenancy. Although Rails doesn't natively support SaaS or multi-tenancy, solutions like Bullet Train and Jumpstart Rails can be used for common SaaS needs.

Next we'll cover database designs from the Apartment and acts_as_tenant gems which support multi-tenancy concepts, then connect their design concepts to Citus's row and schema sharding capabilities from version 12.0.

Weâ€™ll also cover PostgreSQL's LIST partitioning and how to use it for efficient detachment of unneeded customer data.

We'll cover the basics of leveraging Rails 6.1's Horizontal Sharding for database-per-tenant designs.

Besides the benefits for each tool, limitations will be described so that attendees can make informed choices.

Attendees will leave with a broad survey of building multi-tenant SaaS applications, having reviewed application level designs and database designs, to help them put these into action in their own applications.
