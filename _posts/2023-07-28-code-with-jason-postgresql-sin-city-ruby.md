I joined Jason Swett recently on his podcast and had a great time. The podcast topic was PostgreSQL Table Partitioning and how developers can use it. We also discussed the 2024 edition of Sin City Ruby, a conference Jason organizes and is running for the second time next year.

The conference will be held in March of 2024 in Las Vegas.

I attended in 2022, but this time around I'm honored to announce that I'll be speaking at Sin City Ruby 2024. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to create a great presentation involving PostgreSQL and of course Ruby.

## Sin City Ruby 2024

[Sin City Ruby](https://www.sincityruby.com) was a new small single-track conference launched by Jason in 2022. I attended and had a great time. I met Jason there and a number of other Ruby programmers that I've stayed in touch with.

Smaller single-track conferences with a lot of time in between sessions are great for meeting people and networking. üòÅ

I'm looking forward to the 2024 edition and meeting more people! The speaker line-up looks really good.

This is the second time being a guest on Code With Jason. Last year we met for [Episode 160 - PostgreSQL with Andrew Atkinson](https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/11223850-160-postgresql-with-andrew-atkinson/) after I'd spoke at RailsConf 2022 and discussed some topics related to that presentation.

- Why and when would someone use partitioning?
