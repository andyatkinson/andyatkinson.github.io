In a past job we used [delayed_job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) to process background jobs. Delayed Job Web is a UI for Delayed Job.

I made a couple of small contributions, helped merged some pull requests, and was added by the creator, as a maintainer. I enjoyed this opportunity to help out, and performed some upgrades, continued to merge some pull requests, and did some debugging.

Unfortunately I no longer work with Delayed Job and can't focus on the maintanence of it. New pull requests continue to be submitted and many have languished for months or even years. Delayed Job itself continues to be a popular project. So Delayed Job Web really deserves an active maintainer, helping guide the development, merging pull requests, writing documentation etc.

Are you interested in doing that? Please get in touch.
