Back in November I met with Claire Giordano, host of the Talking Postgres podcast, who asked a ton of great questions.

## Some questions
- Why write a book? Was there some moment or spark?
- Why write a technical book?
- Why write a book about Postgres?

## Fun topics
- Planting the seed for writing a book
- Writing a book with Django and Python for Postgres?
- Where does the book fit? Somewhere between documentation, Rails Guides, real use cases with a fictional Rideshare app.
- How long did it take to write this book?
- Did you ever want to quit?
- Did you have a party when the book launched?
- "Little parties" with Rails developers with opportunities at Rails World, Sin City Ruby, Rocky Mountain Ruby, RubyConf Chicago 2024
- Working with other publishers
- Deeply appreciative of the effort from the amazing reviewers!
- We talked about Cheese! 🧀 (very appreciative of help from David Rowley and Melanie Plageman)
- What's my favorite chapter?
- Is there a frequently asked question about databases I get from Rails developers?
- Do clients hire me more for my Rails expertise or Postgres expertise?

[Quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/320581) mentioned by Claire:

> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.
