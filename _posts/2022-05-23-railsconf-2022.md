This past week I had the privilege of presenting at and attending RailsConf 2022 Conference in Portland, OR. My presentation was titled [Puny to Powerful PostgreSQL Rails Apps](https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#session-1276). This post will focus mainly on my presentation experience.

This talk covered 5 challenging areas scaling Rails applications on PostgreSQL databases.

I made a page with extra resources and exercises for the presentation called [PG Puny Powerful](/pg-puny-powerful). I also added some more answers to questions asked during the Q&A after the live presentation.

Here is a view from the presenter perspective at the Oregon Convention Center! My [Fountain](https://get.fountain.com/) teammates at the conference sat in front to support me, which was very thoughtful and encouraging!

#### Volunteering Opportunity

I joined volunteers at the Portland Diaper Bank ([@pdx_diaper_bank](https://twitter.com/pdx_diaper_bank)) to help pack diapers!

Thanks in particular to [Sean](https://twitter.com/seanmarcia) and the [Ruby for Good](https://twitter.com/rubyforgood) organization for creating the volunteer opportunity.

I was able to use my specialized skills in Size 4 diapers, having handled thousands of them before! :)

#### Presentation Experience

Overall I thought the presentation went well. I had done a lot of practice rehearsals so I felt confident in the delivery of the material and had done some editing and culling to fit it into 30 minutes.

PostgreSQL scaling topics are things I love to discuss so I hope my enthusiasm came through and I hope to help others on their learning journey to pay it forward.

I asked some folks in the PostgreSQL and Rails communities for help and they offered me their support either by listening to a practice run and providing feedback, or reviewing earlier drafts of the slides.

#### Community Feedback

I [created](https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1526664596970295296) a hashtag [#PgPunyPowerful](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PgPunyPowerful) which I used for a few purposes:

* Tried to build some hype in advance
* Welcomed feedback via twitter
* Tweeted links to the presentation and additional materials

It sort of worked! It was an experiment to create more engagement and continue the conversation.

#### Highlighted Feedback

Some folks tweeted out support for the presentation, which I really appreciated!
