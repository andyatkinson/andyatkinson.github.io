Remote work can make it more difficult to remember that we're all working with other humans that are unique and have their own personality, quirks, interests and aspirations.

Remote workers rely on technologies to help stay connected with their teammates, with the underlying goal of high quality communication, to work on the right things and stay motivated.

Here are a few simple ways to help this process along:

- Set an avatar on all company services. This could be Google, Atlassian, Slack and other services, but having a picture helps people find and identify you.
- Use a microphone on calls. I have several Apple earbuds so I can leave one in my bag, at my home office, travel luggage etc. Try for the best audio and speakers you can use reliably and comfortably.
- Try for good video with light in front to illuminate the speaker's face. Taking to a silhouette is awkward.
- Use emoticons, emojis, Slack reactions, gifs etc. This helps show some of your personality. If this is distracting a group chat room can be dedicated for joking around.
- Be responsive by chat. I'm on the go frequently which is something that is possible without having a specific office, but I try to respond with my availability if I can't answer something right away, and give people a heads up when I know I'll be out in addition to keeping my calendar up-to-date (or shared vacation calendars).
- Hop on video calls and pair up on problems (with multiple cursors) when possible. Collaborating helps build camaderie. Pairing (secondary role) is my preferred way to teach 1 on 1.
