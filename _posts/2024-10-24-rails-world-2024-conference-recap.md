This is Part 1 of my Rails World 2024 Recap! I'm planning a Part 2 once session recordings are available and I've watched some, and I'll share my thoughts and reactions.

Since I prioritized conversations with people at the conferences, handing out books, and generally chatting about Postgres and Rails, I wasn't able to attend a lot of sessions I had originally planned on.

Fortunately, I can watch recorded sessions as I did for [Rails World 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHFP2OPUpCeY9IX3Ht727dwu5ZJ2BBbZP).

## Arrival - Wednesday

üá®üá¶ Landed in Toronto. Excited to rep the book, meet attendees, and give away 8 copies over the next few days. Feeling grateful!

To celebrate my book launch and successfully striking out on my own as an independent Postgres and Rails consultant,
I hosted a happy hour gathering of Postgres fans at #RailsWorld. Good turnout, conversations, and new and strengthened connections. Success! üôå

I cut off signups initially at 12, then again at 15, as we only had a table booking for 12.

This was my first time hosting an event like this. I was able to sponsor a round of drinks and appetizers as a celebration of successfully launching my book and consulting business.

It felt great to have this opportunity to bring folks together and I appreciated everyone coming out and getting to know their fellow attendees.

Afterwards, most of the group walked over to the Shopify pre-registration event to get badges, hang out, and grab dinner.

## Conference Day 1 - Thursday

In the kick-off, I appreciated the overview of the Rails Foundation activities, and was excited to see my GitHub handle up on screen briefly, along with some friends!

## Session: DHH Keynote

David‚Äôs keynote was good. It was a bit of storytelling and individual positions and perspectives, with occasional splashes of tech stuff mixed in.

Last year being the inaugural Rails World, although I wasn‚Äôt there in person but watched the YouTube recording, I felt like maybe covered more ground between what Rails World is, the Rails Foundation, all the updates planned for Rails 8.

One benefit in Rails World 2024 though is that Rails 8 Beta 1 is now shipping. The technical work over the last year made this possible.

The stories I walked away with this year was sort of a call to action to be more competent in our roles as software engineers. Although it wasn‚Äôt said exactly, I wondered how much of this message was in response to the rise of AI-assisted programming.

With the quality and prevalence of AI-assisted programming, I think it raises the floor on value a software engineer must bring in terms of their ability to design and operate systems.

## Session: Postgres at Instacart

Got to meet Mostafa afterwards briefly. I didn‚Äôt know Mostafa was a contributor to PgCat, pretty cool. Mostafa talked about different approaches to sharding, including vertical and horizontal sharding.

Makara gem. PgCart connection pooler.

This was probably more of an ‚Äúexposure to concepts‚Äù talk for talks vs. a game plan. Instacart operates at large scale. It‚Äôs

## Session: Fireside Chat DHH, Matz, Tobi

This was interesting to see. I knew Matz didn't normally attend Ruby on Rails conferences, so it was exciting to see him attending. I should have taken the opportunity to ask for a picture, but did see plenty of others walking around getting selfies.


## Event: Rails Startups With Evil Martians and Whop

This was a fun event! Appreciate being invited by Irina. Had the chance to meet Jack from [Whop](https://whop.com). Met a lot of other folks in person like [Kir](https://kirshatrov.com), Miles, Yaroslov from [SupeRails](https://superails.com).


## Conference Day 2 - Friday

On Day 2, the highlight and emphasis for me was a Book Signing opportunity.

<small>Book Signing at Rails World 2024</small>

Although it was meant to be a 1 hour session from 12pm - 1pm over the lunch period, I was able to meet a lot of people before and after, to generally chat about the book, Postgres, Rails, and more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got a signed copy of High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails from <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@andatki</a> himself!

While waiting for a car to the airport, I had a serendipitous opportunity to join Craig Kerstiens from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com) for a shared ride. Obviously we talked about Postgres!
