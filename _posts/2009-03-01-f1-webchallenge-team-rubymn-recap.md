This year I participated in the [F1 Web Challenge](http://f1webchallenge.com/). The event brings together teams of programmers, designers, and project managers with non-profit organizations. The goal is to build a professional website for the non-profit in less than 24 hours, and teams compete against each other for the overall best website.

[Sierra Bravo](http://www.sierra-bravo.com/) (event sponsor) covered the event in depth on their [Nerdery blog](http://blog.nerdery.com/tag/webchallenge/).

The non-profit we were assigned was "Resource Center of the Americas."

#### Technical details

 - Built new site with [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org/)
 - Built a basic Paypal integration for e-commerce using Website Payments Standard
 - Managed Radiant plugins as git submodules
 - Github sponsored our team and [wrote a blog post about it](http://github.com/blog/364-f1-web-challenge)! We used github throughout the competition
 - Deployment was managed with capistrano (thanks [@tomtoday](http://twitter.com/tomtoday))
 - 1 year of [Slicehost VPS hosting](http://www.slicehost.com/) (and t-shirts!) was paid for by a [Tightrope Media Systems](http://www.trms.com/) sponsorship
 - Built a team twitter and flickr aggregator site with Sinatra
 
#### Conclusion

This was an excellent experience personally speaking, and I think most of my teammates felt the same way. It was satisfying to be able to contribute something meaningful to a a good organization. I also really enjoyed meeting the other participants and spending time with my team members.
