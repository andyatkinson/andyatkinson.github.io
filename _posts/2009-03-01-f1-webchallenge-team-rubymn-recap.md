This year I participated in the [F1 Web Challenge](http://f1webchallenge.com/), an event that brings together teams of programmers and designers with non-profit organizations, with the shared goal of building the non-profit a professional website in less than 24 hours. The event is also a competition, one winner is chosen.

[Sierra Bravo](http://www.sierra-bravo.com/) (event sponsor) covered the event in depth on their [Nerdery blog](http://blog.nerdery.com/tag/webchallenge/). Look there for more recap posts from participants.

The non-profit we were assigned was "Resource Center of the Americas." We have not officially launched the redesigned site yet, I will update this post when the site is live.

Technical details
----
 - Built new site with [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org/)
 - Built a basic Paypal integration for e-commerce using Website Payments Standard	
 - Managed Radiant plugins as git submodules
 - Github sponsored our team and [wrote a blog post about it](http://github.com/blog/364-f1-web-challenge)! We used github throughout the competition
 - Deployment was managed with capistrano (thanks [@tomtoday](http://twitter.com/tomtoday))
 - 1 year of [Slicehost VPS hosting](http://www.slicehost.com/) (and t-shirts!) was paid for by a [Tightrope Media Systems](http://www.trms.com/) sponsorship
 - Built a team twitter and flickr aggregator site with Sinatra
 
This was an excellent experience personally speaking, and I think most of my teammates felt the same way. It was satisfying to be able to contribute something meaningful to an organization that is doing good work in the community, and put my technical skills to good use, as well as meet more future collaborators, and local community folks.

A great event. Thanks to the host for continuing to put this on, they did a great job!
