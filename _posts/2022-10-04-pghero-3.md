We just upgraded to [3.0 of PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) (Check the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)). I learned about the availability of the new version from the [Postgres.fm](https://postgres.fm/) ðŸŽ§ podcast.

PgHero is a tool we use to monitor operational issues with PostgreSQL. Some of the main things we monitor are:

* Slow queries. PgHero uses [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) which normalizes and collects statistics about all running queries. We can focus on queries that are called a lot and are slow, as they are consuming the most resources on the server. This approach is a [macro analysis](https://postgres.fm/episodes/macro-query-analysis-intro) approach to load reduction.
* Unused indexes. We can find unused indexes on tables with high writes and reads, and remove those to [save space and improve performance](/blog/2021/07/30/postgresql-index-maintenance).
* Invalid indexes. These typically need to be re-created.
* Constraints that are marked `NOT VALID`. In some cases, we do not ever intend to validate these constraints. I talked in a lot of detail about this topic with Jason on a recent "Code With Jason" Episode ([160 - PostgreSQL with Andrew Atkinson](https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/11223850-160-postgresql-with-andrew-atkinson/)) ðŸŽ¤ -- check it out!

In the episode we discussed Check constraints, but in our database typically we're looking at foreign key constraints marked `NOT VALID`. I have some ideas for PgHero on how we can better present constraints in this state.

## Some customizations weâ€™ve made
We're able to add customizations to PgHero on a branch and try them out on our database. For useful functionality, we can propose the changes back upstream as a PR.

* Monitoring (estimated) index bloat percentage. Although this was rejected for upstream, we've found it useful to show the bloat on this page and as a percentage. ([PR #393](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/pull/393)) We do rebuild indexes periodically automatically, so it isn't as critical.
* Monitoring database scheduled jobs ([earlier closed draft #408](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/pull/408)). We schedule jobs like index rebuilds and partition management with [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron). Listing pg_cron Scheduled Jobs is not something that exists currently in PgHero, but is something I've added on our fork and find useful. When the code has appropriate tests and documentation, I plan to propose it upstream again.

## Some additional things I want to add
* Improved handling of partitioned tables

I have a theory there are inaccurate counts (e.g. unused indexes) in PgHero due to the indexes being counted multiple times across partitions for a partitioned table. I need to verify that theory on our fork and on partitioned tables, and if so I'll work on a fix and propose it back.

## What's new in 3.0?
* Added `visualize_url` to config. This looks like a way to link to an explain plan for a query. I'll need to try this out.
* Adjustments to AWS Metrics names. We are not currently using this functionality.
* Removed support for older dependency versions for Ruby, Rails, pg_query, and aws-sdk.

It doesnâ€™t look like there are any major new features. Primarily it looks like 3.0 was about ending support for older dependencies, which makes sense.

PgHero is a very useful tool for us - thank you to the maintainers!
