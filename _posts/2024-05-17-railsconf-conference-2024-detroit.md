## On the flight, arrival, hotel
- Quick flight from Minneapolis to Detroit
- When arriving at the hotel, I noticed the riverfront walk, the elevated train, and the conference center were all really nice. Great location!

## Long-time Friends and New Ones
Having attended Sin City Ruby twice and RailsConf once other times in the last couple of years, it was really nice to reconnect with a lot of Ruby world friends.

Some of them were Jeremy, Kasper, Chris, Collin, Cody, Vladimir, Chris, Dominic, Irin, Jason, Elise, Ifat, Kevin (too briefly!), PDX Jared M. from RailsConf 2022, Mayra from ‚Äò22.

I loved meeting new people as well! I met Manu at the speaker‚Äôs dinner. Manu presented on Falcon and Async Ruby, and I hope to catch the recording. Peter S., Nathan S., [Youssef B.](https://x.com/railsconf/status/1786440716605964491) spoke on ‚ÄúAsk your logs‚Äù and I hope to catch this recording! Garrett and I hung out and talked NBA basketball! Felipe V.!

I met some of the Revela team there, including the CTO John and engineer John S. Also Wes G.

I stayed after Nadia Odunayo‚Äôs great (co-founder of The StoryGraph) opening morning keynote. I wanted to introduce myself to Nadia given they‚Äôre scaling up and building on Rails and PostgreSQL, and offer up some kind of future collaboration! Besides my PostgreSQL skills, as a new author, I appreciate that they‚Äôre building a new platform for communities around books.

For The StoryGraph, I hope to get my first review or rating for High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails on the site. It‚Äôs currently empty!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a>, I‚Äôd love for the first rating or review from a reader of my book to get added to <a href="https://twitter.com/thestorygraph?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thestorygraph</a>!<br><br>I‚Äôll be giving away free ebook copies of the book this week or you can get it for under 20 bucks with code RailsConf2024PG. üòä cc <a href="https://twitter.com/nodunayo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nodunayo</a><a href="https://t.co/j8YJlYiRYE">https://t.co/j8YJlYiRYE</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787856253131030968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

John Nunemaker! Apparently John [hasn‚Äôt been to RailsConf since 2010](https://www.johnnunemaker.com/railsconf-2024/), and I recall seeing John there way back then!

[RailsConf 2010 was in Baltimore](/blog/2010/07/01/railsconf-2010), which was significant for me, as my wife and I had just to Baltimore at the time! I was excited RailsConf was in my new adopted city.

RailsConf came back again in 2011, and I went again! The next time I went to RailsConf was 6 years later for [RailsConf Phoenix in 2017](http://andyatkinson.com/blog/2017/06/06/railsconf-2017). That one was also great, and was where I originally met Kasper H. I remember writing Java around that time working at Groupon!

Who else was someone new to meet? Sairo from Venezuela, who gave a lightning talk! I also got to meet Joshua Wood and Ben Curtis from Honeybadger, and shared that I was a big fan of their product!

I also got to meet Xavier Noria and spend a whole lunch with Xavier. We had a great conversation about some of the challenges as independent consultants, the benefits, and about writing technical books.

Another person was Erica who I met off and on throughout the conference, and who later gave Lightning talk!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ö°Ô∏è Erica kicking off the <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a> lightning talks! <a href="https://t.co/BZyYn9M5Ks">pic.twitter.com/BZyYn9M5Ks</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1788628346152042752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Daniel Colson and I met in person briefly!

## Meet the Authors
The RailsConf staff was gracious to give some authors an opportunity to get on stage, and answer questions from the audience about writing technical books. Besides myself, authors Noel Rappin and Vladimir Dymentrev were on the stage. Garrett Dimon couldn‚Äôt make it but was also an author in attendance.


## Workshop

Overall I thought the workshop went well. There were a couple of things that could have gone better, but overall not bad. It was a real honor to bring topics like reading EXPLAIN query plans and designing supportive indexes to developers, that seemed to be soaking it up for the most part.

In the second half, almost no one had set up a Postgres replica from scratch, and may not realistically do that ever in their jobs. However, if they‚Äôre using a replica that‚Äôs been set up for them, they‚Äôve got the chance to see it was done.

Unfortunately there was a replication error that had to do with the system identifier not matching, which seems to happen sometimes when the container restarts and doesn‚Äôt use the expected data directory.

Someone gave me feedback ‚ÄúI handled it well‚Äù, and indeed it wasn‚Äôt really critical to complete in order to understand the higher level abstraction, using Active Record Multiple Databases.

What we tried to show was configuring the primary as the ‚Äúwriter‚Äù role, and the replica as the ‚Äúreader‚Äù role. This opens up using the replica instance for read-only queries. Having a live replica ready to go in the event that the primary instance fails, is a good idea. This can greatly improve your recovery time. However, we can also use that instance for our read only queries. Naturally, there are a lot of questions about ‚Äúreplica lag‚Äù and ‚Äúread your own write.‚Äù Fortunately for ‚Äúread your own write‚Äù or ‚Äúread after write‚Äù consistency, Active Record has a default implementation. If that doesn‚Äôt cut it, we can extend it.

## Closing Keynote from Irina
Great closing keynote from Irina, encouraging us all to be more public about building with Rails. I thought the concept and delivery of Irina‚Äôs talk was really good, by interviewing lots of companies building with Rails, showing their logos, and telling their stories.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great keynote concept and delivery from <a href="https://twitter.com/inazarova?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@inazarova</a> sharing stories from startups choosing Ruby on Rails! <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a> <a href="https://t.co/GEKCKWvu1f">pic.twitter.com/GEKCKWvu1f</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787956394802770331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Book
For me this conference was sort of a capstone experience from writing this book over the last two years. I presented at RailsConf 2022 in Portland, and at the time I‚Äôd just signed the book deal, but it was a secret, and very much on the ‚Äúriskier‚Äù side of things having only a single chapter written of what would become 15 chapters. A big risk is the big never happens. 

I was able to meet some of the people that directly contributed like Ifat, Xavier, Kevin Murphy (very briefly) as official technical reviewers, or unofficial reviewers as folks that graciously read a portion and provided feedback.

I printed a sign, and two types of stickers in advance.

I really enjoyed dropping stickers around. I‚Äôm really proud of the book and I hope it helps a lot of readers. We also gave away 5 ebook copies, and ran a 40% discount code that might still be active, depending on when you read this!

The giveaway was for people that attended the workshop. I even made a little Ruby program to generate random emails, hiding them from the screen, but showing the drawing process live.

My goal was for about 50 copies of the book to sell in the time of the conference, by promoting it on social media, handing out stickers, telling people about it.

I‚Äôm happy to say we got there! The book was back into the #2 bestseller spot among [weekly bestsellers](https://pragprog.com/best_sellers/) this week.

## Consulting
Something different compared with any other time in my 15  year programming career, is that I‚Äôm working as an independent consultant now. I had the chance to meet a lot of other consultants like Wale, Cody Jason, Jeremy, Kasper, and learn from them. Unfortunately I missed a consulting Birds of a Feather session, but it sounds like it was quite valuable.

## Hamtramck, MI
Joshua and Ben Cutis from Honeybadger organized a progressive dinner walking tour, provided by Detroit History Tours. We met in the Hamtramck city, which we learned is a city that‚Äôs entirely land-locked within the city of Detroit. Strange!

{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/assets/images/posts/2024/railsconf-2024-3.jpg" title="Tour group at RailsConf conference 2024" caption="Tour group, Hamtramck, MI. Photo credit: Benjamin W." %}

The oddities didn‚Äôt stop there. We learned about interesting historical buildings, characters, and their lives, as we dined on some delicious food at the same buildings featured in the tour. We were fortunate to get great weather, and I loved the small group format as a nice way to get to know people, the tour itself, and the food!

As a result of attending this, I missed the RailsConf rooftop patio time, which also looked great. Irina recorded a nice video of that, which provides a glimpse into the vibe:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is heaven! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RailsConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RailsConf</a> <a href="https://t.co/vyaGARqOLr">pic.twitter.com/vyaGARqOLr</a></p>&mdash; Irina Nazarova (@inazarova) <a href="https://twitter.com/inazarova/status/1788328919193600361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


## Wrap Up ‚Äî The Long Goodbye
RailsConf 2024 for me was perfect. I had the privilege of presenting on PostgreSQL, Active Record, and database topics to 100 people, and appreciated getting feedback from a dozen or so people afterwards that they enjoyed the workshop.

I was able to meet 30-40 people individually through the 3 days, to make some new professional contacts, find new work, form and strengthen friendships, and tell people about [my book](/pgrailsbook)! I feel very fortunate to have had this opportunity.

Although RailsConf 2025 will be the last one ever, which is sad, I have a lot of reasons to be happy.

I'm looking back fondly at my first RailsConf back in 2010, and reflecting on the opportunities I've had, people I've met, and how my career has evolved. It's bittersweet.

I hope to see you at RailsConf 2025 where we'll give it a proper goodbye!
