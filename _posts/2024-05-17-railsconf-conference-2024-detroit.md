## Opening
This post is a look back at the weeks leading up to RailsConf 2024, and significant events from the event! There's a big change coming in 2025. Read on to learn more!

## Pre-conference activities
- I gave a local, first run of the workshop content for [High Performance Active Record Apps](http://andyatkinson.com/blog/2024/04/10/workshop-active-record-postgresql-apps-minneapolis) in Minneapolis at Industrious. About 15 attended! This first run helped me realize I had too much content and needed to set up examples to copy and paste.
- I was a guest on the Ruby for All podcast for episode [RailsConf 2024 Workshop Spotlight ‚Äî Build High Performance Active Record Apps with Andy Atkinson](https://www.rubyforall.com/s2/67). This provided another opportunity to prepare a bit.


## On the flight, arrival, hotel
- Quick flight from Minneapolis to Detroit
- The hotel, river walk, elevated train, and conference center were all very nice.

## Long-time Friends and New Ones
Having attended Sin City Ruby twice and RailsConf two years ago, it was nice to reconnect with a lot of friends from the Ruby world.

Some were Jeremy, Kasper, Chris, Collin, Cody, Vladimir, Chris, Dominic, Irina, Jason, Elise, Ifat, Kevin (too briefly!), PDX Jared M. from RailsConf 2022, and (briefly) Mayra from ‚Äò22.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Adam Driver aka <a href="https://twitter.com/collin_jilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@collin_jilbert</a> teaching us how to contribute to Rails! cc <a href="https://twitter.com/GoRails?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoRails</a> <a href="https://t.co/L1ebo7fcuS">pic.twitter.com/L1ebo7fcuS</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787925574649860132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I loved meeting new people too! I met Manu at the speaker‚Äôs dinner. Manu presented on Falcon and Async Ruby, and I hope to catch the recording. Peter S., Nathan S., [Youssef B.](https://x.com/railsconf/status/1786440716605964491) spoke on "Ask your logs" and I hope to catch this recording! Garrett and I hung out and talked NBA basketball! I also met Felipe V. via the workshop!

I met some of the Revela team there, including the CTO John and engineer John S. Also Wes G.

I stayed after Nadia Odunayo‚Äôs great opening morning keynote to introduce myself. Their team is scaling up, building on Rails and PostgreSQL, and I wanted to offer up some kind of future collaboration opportunity!

For The StoryGraph, I hope to get my first review or rating for High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails on the site. While we've got some [ratings on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209538533-high-performance-postgresql-for-rails), The StoryGraph is currently empty!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a>, I‚Äôd love for the first rating or review from a reader of my book to get added to <a href="https://twitter.com/thestorygraph?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thestorygraph</a>!<br><br>I‚Äôll be giving away free ebook copies of the book this week or you can get it for under 20 bucks with code RailsConf2024PG. üòä cc <a href="https://twitter.com/nodunayo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nodunayo</a><a href="https://t.co/j8YJlYiRYE">https://t.co/j8YJlYiRYE</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787856253131030968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

John Nunemaker! Apparently John [hasn‚Äôt been to RailsConf since 2010](https://www.johnnunemaker.com/railsconf-2024/), and I recall seeing John there way back then.

[RailsConf 2010 was in Baltimore](/blog/2010/07/01/railsconf-2010), which was significant for me, as my wife and I had just moved to Baltimore! I was excited that RailsConf was in my new adopted city.

RailsConf was back in 2011, and I went again! After those two Baltimore RailsConf editions, I didn‚Äôt go again until 6 years later for [RailsConf Phoenix in 2017](http://andyatkinson.com/blog/2017/06/06/railsconf-2017). That one was also great, and was where I originally met Kasper H.

I also met Sairo from Venezuela at the hotel bar, and we talked about consulting. The next day Sairo gave a lightning talk! I also met Joshua Wood and Ben Curtis from Honeybadger, and shared that I was a big fan of their product!

I also met [Xavier Noria](https://hashref.com) in person, spending a whole lunch together. We had a great conversation about some of the challenges as independent consultants, the benefits, and about writing technical books.

Another person I met was Erica who was a scholar, and gave a Lightning talk!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ö°Ô∏è Erica kicking off the <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a> lightning talks! <a href="https://t.co/BZyYn9M5Ks">pic.twitter.com/BZyYn9M5Ks</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1788628346152042752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Daniel Colson and I had been online friends, and met very briefly in person!

## Meet the Authors
The RailsConf staff was gracious to give some authors an opportunity to get on stage, and answer questions from the audience about writing technical books. Besides myself, authors [Noel Rappin](https://x.com/noelrap) and [Vladimir Dementyev](https://x.com/palkan_tula) were on the stage. [Garrett Dimon](https://x.com/garrettdimon) couldn‚Äôt make it but was another author at RailsConf.


## Workshop
Workshop Day!

Overall I thought the workshop went well. There were a couple of things that could have gone better, but overall it was pretty good. It was a real honor to bring topics like reading EXPLAIN query plans and designing supportive indexes, to developers that might not work in these areas much.

In the second half, we set up a Postgres replica instance from scratch, with both instances running in Docker containers, then talked about how two instances could be used for writing and reading roles with Active Record.

## Closing Keynote from Irina
Irina gave a great closing keynote, encouraging us all to be more public about building with Rails. I thought the concept and delivery of Irina‚Äôs talk was really good, interviewing current and active Rails teams, and helping tell their stories.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great keynote concept and delivery from <a href="https://twitter.com/inazarova?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@inazarova</a> sharing stories from startups choosing Ruby on Rails! <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a> <a href="https://t.co/GEKCKWvu1f">pic.twitter.com/GEKCKWvu1f</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787956394802770331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Book
For me this conference was sort of a celebration of the long and mostly lonely process of [writing my first book](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/) over the last two years.

I [presented at RailsConf 2022 in Portland](http://andyatkinson.com/blog/2022/05/23/railsconf-2022), and at the time I‚Äôd just signed the book deal, but it was a secret, and very much a "riskier" project being so early in development.

I was able to meet some of the people that directly contributed to the book in the following two years, like Ifat, Xavier, Kevin Murphy a bit at RailsConf, which was nice.

Since the book itself wasn‚Äôt ready in time in print, I printed stickers in advance and enjoyed handing them at and dropping them on tables of stickers at the conference. They were getting picked up, which was fun!

I‚Äôm really proud of the book and I hope it helps a lot of readers. We also gave away 5 ebook copies, and ran a 40% discount code, to help drive some more awareness and sales!

The giveaway was for people that attended the workshop. I even made a little Ruby program to generate random emails, hiding them from the screen, but showing the drawing process live.

## Consulting
Now working as a consultant, after having mostly worked as a full-time employee, I was really curious to hear from others working in this model.

I met other independent consultants like Wale O. ([Rails Fever, LLC](https://railsfever.com)), Xavier, Cody N., Jason S., Jeremy S., and Kasper ([@kaspth](https://github.com/kaspth)), and appreciated hearing their perspectives and about their experience.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Packed room for <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kaspth</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/railsconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@railsconf</a>! <a href="https://t.co/c9cI6rLghp">pic.twitter.com/c9cI6rLghp</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Atkinson (@andatki) <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1787951973058187691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


## Hamtramck, MI
Joshua and Ben Cutis from [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io) organized a progressive dinner walking tour, provided by Detroit History Tours. We met in the Hamtramck city, which we learned is a city that‚Äôs entirely land-locked within the city of Detroit.

{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/assets/images/posts/2024/railsconf-2024-3.jpg" title="Tour group at RailsConf conference 2024" caption="Tour group, Hamtramck, MI. Photo credit: Benjamin W." %}

We learned about interesting historical buildings, characters, and their lives, as we dined on some delicious food at the same buildings featured in the tour. This was a nice event!

However, I couldn‚Äôt be in two places at once. I missed the RailsConf rooftop patio time, which also looked great. Irina recorded a video of that on display below.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is heaven! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RailsConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RailsConf</a> <a href="https://t.co/vyaGARqOLr">pic.twitter.com/vyaGARqOLr</a></p>&mdash; Irina Nazarova (@inazarova) <a href="https://twitter.com/inazarova/status/1788328919193600361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Wrap Up ‚Äî The Long Goodbye
For me, RailsConf 2024 was a perfect event. I was fortunate to be a presenter on a topic I love discussing and writing about. Getting nearly 100 people to show up to hear about databases is not easy, and I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs because they were really interested to learn about this. I hope they found it valuable.

Besides the content itself, I loved meeting dozens of old and new friends!

On the first day, we found out that RailsConf 2025 will be the last one. For me this was sad to hear, considering my first RailsConf was nearly 15 years ago, and they‚Äôve been a significant part of my professional journey.

With [RailsConf ending in 2025](https://rubycentral.org/news/anewearforrubycentralevents/), we‚Äôre now in a ‚Äúlong goodbye‚Äù period, and might be reflecting on happy memories, experiencing sadness the event is ending, or nostalgia for past events.

Ruby Central will now focus on Rubyconf as the flagship event. In 2024, Ruby events are doing well! This year, Ruby Kaigi in Japan had more than 1000 attendees! Regional Ruby conferences are popping up all over, just check <https://rubyconferences.org/> for one in your area.

Ruby on Rails will continue to be celebrated annually at the [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024) conference, in its second year, being held in Toronto later this year.

Looking forward to RailsConf 2025, where we''ll celebrate the end of this decades-long event, together!
