Hello World! Creating blogs with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) is easy. Since Jekyll is built-in to Github Pages, making blog updates is as simple as doing a `git push`.  I like how the page management aspect moves from the blog software to the version control system.

This approach fits my workflow. I can edit posts in Textmate, preview Markdown formatted-text with `control-option-command p`, add code samples, then commit and push when I'm done. Nice!

Jekyll uses [Liquid Templating](http://www.liquidmarkup.org/) and has some view helpers for layout. Jeykll can be installed as a gem and generate a site locally as well, however that isn't needed to get started with github pages.  [mojombo](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) even encourages using his layouts and CSS to get rolling, making it even easier to start. Paid github account holders can also map their own domain names to their github user page.

Are you using Jekyll for your blog?
