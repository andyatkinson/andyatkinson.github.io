This tip describes how to write a rake task in a gem, then use it in another Ruby gem or Rails app.

#### Create a rake task in a gem

Create a `lib/tasks` directory in your gem. Create a rake task in that directory with the same syntax it would have in the Rakefile. The file should have the `.rake` extension.

Now include the rake task in the Rakefile for the gem by using `import`. For example: `import "./lib/tasks/downloader.rake"`.

#### Use the rake task in another gem

In the second gem, create a `Rakefile` for the project and load it using the `load` method. As an example, we can load the "downloader" rake file from the *corenlp* gem [^gem] with this snippet:

``` ruby
spec = Gem::Specification.find_by_name 'corenlp'
load "#{spec.gem_dir}/lib/tasks/downloader.rake"
```

Verify the task shows up when running `rake -T` (make sure the task has a description!) and can be invoked as expected.

#### Use the rake task in a Rails app

We used `load` in the Rakefile for a Rails app in the same way. Working with the [Railtie](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Railtie.html) [^railtie] could be another way to include the task.

#### Conclusion

Sharing rake tasks between Ruby apps keeps your code DRY. If you found this tip useful let me know! Thanks for checking it out.
