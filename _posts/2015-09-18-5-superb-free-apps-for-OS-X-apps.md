OS X has some excellent free apps that help me get work done each day. Give these a shot. If you find them useful, let the app developers know and consider donating to help with their development costs.

 * Spectacle [^spec] &mdash; move windows around with keyboard shortcuts
 * Itsycal [^itsycal] &mdash; menu bar calendar
 * MacDown [^mac] &mdash; Markdown editor
 * Cyberduck [^duck] &mdash; S3 client
 * LICEcap [^lice] &mdash; simple animated GIFs

#### Spectacle

Spectacle has a straightforward design and easy-to-learn shortcuts. I use shortcuts to resize and move windows to 50% of the screen every day. Resizing and moving windows around is particulary useful moving from working on an external monitor to a laptop screen.

#### Itsycal

Itsycal shows the day of the month, and makes it easy to navigate back and forth by month. When discussing project timelines at work, having a quick calendar to reference is very convenient.

#### MacDown

A stylish Markdown editor that works well. Mou is what I used previously but MacDown works even better. Thanks for the tip Dan!

#### Cyberduck

Cyberduck has been around for a long time. In the past I used it as an FTP client, but these days though I've found it works well as an Amazon S3 client.

#### LICEcap

Really simple animated GIFs. They loop by default, though the size and number of repetitions can be customized. Thanks Rodolfo!


The authors of these fine pieces of software deserve recognition. Great work, useful tools. Thanks!
