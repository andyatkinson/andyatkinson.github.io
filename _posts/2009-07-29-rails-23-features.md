Some feaures from Rails 2.3 that I wanted to highlight:

#### Templates

Rails application templates are a way to put project configuration in a single file. Common setup chores like installing gems, plugins, JavaScript libraries, adding initializers, or writing custom rake tasks can be automated with Rails templates. 

Use `rails app -m mytemplate` or a template can even be applied to an existing project. Browsing templates on github is also a nice way to see which tools and techniques other developers are using.

#### Nested Model Forms

It is complicated but it saves code.

#### Use Seed Data

Managing seed data in the conventional rails way makes it easier for new team members to figure out how to get development data to work with. 

`rake db:seed` and `rake db:setup` are new tasks to manage application data while the application code is being developed.
