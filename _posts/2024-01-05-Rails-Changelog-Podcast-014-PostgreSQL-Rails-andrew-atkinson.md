Back in September, the week before [Emmanuel Hayford](https://www.railschangelog.com/people/emmanuel-hayford) traveled to Rails World, and I traveled to [PGConf NYC](/blog/2023/10/10/pgconf-nyc-2023), we connected for the [14th episode of the Rails Changelog podcast](https://www.railschangelog.com/14).

Emmanuel has been landing top-notch guests from Ruby on Rails! Check out this look back at the [Rails Changelog podcast guests from 2023](https://twitter.com/siaw23/status/1740632809062924448).

Fun fact: Emmanuel and I have both been editors for [This Week in Rails](https://hayford.dev/about/), a long-running co-edited newsletter. I‚Äôm no longer active, but enjoyed my time on the project and [meeting up with co-editors at RailsConf 2017](/blog/2017/06/06/railsconf-2017).

What sorts of things did we talk about? Prior to the episode, we devised a plan to cover Ruby on Rails features that are database related, and connect them to their coverage in my new book [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/).

## Topics

In the episode, you‚Äôll find conversations about these topics:

- What is Strict Loading, and how is it related to N+1 queries?
- Generated columns, virtual and stored, and how they‚Äôre used in Active Record for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Common table expressions (CTE), subqueries, when you‚Äôd want to use them
- What is sharding? Horizontal Sharding and application level sharding with Active Record in Ruby on Rails
- Query Logs, what are they? When would I use them instead of my APM?

## Notes

- Emmanuel was glad to see that most features that are covered in the book have a corresponding code example in the Rideshare application. This is the application readers use to learn the concepts, and it‚Äôs available on GitHub.
- I talked about how I wanted the book to be practical based on my career experience, and for readers to learn concepts with hands-on exercises. This fit the ethos of Pragmatic Programmers books, which made me excited to work with them.


## Contest

We even did a contest ([contest on twitter](https://twitter.com/railschangelog/status/1723012816825680201)), giving away a copy of the book. Emmanuel handled the promotion on social media and did a bang-up job. Thank you! The winner let us know they were really happy to receive it.

If you missed the contest, stay tuned to [my newsletter](https://pgrailsbook.com/) or social media, where I‚Äôll similar contests in the future.


## Sharing the episode

We shared the episode in a few places:

- Sharing on [/r/rails Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17mhz7p/14_talking_postgresql_with_andrew_atkinson/)
- [Rails Changelog account tweet](https://twitter.com/railschangelog/status/1720234615900656006)
- [My tweet announcing the episode](https://twitter.com/andatki/status/1720437672592752648)


## Wrap Up

Emmanuel was a great host, and I had a lot of fun talking about Rails and PostgreSQL features, and how developers can use them.

I hope the episode is useful for listeners learning how to use these features, and to expand their knowledge of what‚Äôs possible with PostgreSQL.

Emmanuel and I hope to meet up someday in-person, at a future Rails World or Ruby on Rails related event. Maybe we‚Äôll see you there too!
