I recently joined Michael and Nikolay as a guest on a favorite podcast of mine, [postgres.fm](https://postgres.fm), which has been a favorite going back to when it started in August 2022. Why's that?

## Why I like the postgres.fm podcast

As a weekly-release podcast covering PostgreSQL for nearly 100 episodes, Michael and Nikolay have covered a lot of ground! All of the episodes have great content, covering a nice level of depth, in a short amount of time. Each host brings their unique perspective.

The launch of the podcast overlapped with writing my PostgreSQL book. Most Friday mornings of episode releases, I‚Äôd hop onto my treadmill and listen. I‚Äôd usually have follow-up ideas and notes from each episode.

The weekly release cadence helped me stay motivated while writing, and the coverage helped broaden my perspectives.

I‚Äôm really thankful to Michael and Nikolay for creating the podcast, and releasing episodes each week. I know it‚Äôs been a lot of work for them, and it's been quite generous of them to share their knowledge with the community.

Now, on with the Rails + Postgres episode!

## Is Postgres a popular choice for Rails?

This was the first question from Michael. It's difficult to answer with confidence, especially since I'm in sort of a bubble of PostgreSQL fans.

Subjectively, PostgreSQL feels like the most popular relational database choice for new Rails apps.

To add a little objectivity, we did bring in the Planet Argon survey with results from more than 2600 respondents from 2022.

The 2022 Ruby on Rails Community Survey from Planet Argon[^1] responses show that PostgreSQL took over in 2014 from MySQL, as the top choice of being "typically used" as the relational database, and has continued to stay there.

## What about MySQL and others?

As far as other open source relational databases, MySQL or MariaDB are popular for Ruby on Rails apps today, and have been since Rails started in the 2000s. Companies like Shopify, GitHub, Airbnb that famously adopted Ruby on Rails in the 2000s and continue to use it, all generally started with MySQL and continue to use it. For those companies that have invested heavily in performance, sharding,[^2] and other operations, it makes a lot of sense to stick with their relational database.

The investments these companies have made into Ruby on Rails though still provides benefits to PostgreSQL.

From investments into Active Record engineers at those companies have made into open source, PostgreSQL has gained framework support for Multiple Databases, including support for sharding as "Horizontal Sharding," read and write splitting with automatic routing of reads to a replica ("Automatic Role Switching"), and more.

We can see this investment by digging into the commit history for Ruby on Rails and Active Record from engineers at those companies, and for features like Horizontal Sharding. [^3]

[^3]: <https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#horizontal-sharding>

Other supported relational database options include SQLite.

Commercial relational databases like Oracle or SQL Server (MS SQL), or non-relational databases like MongoDB or DynamoDB may work with Active Record, but require additional library code.

## How do folks typically query Postgres from a Rails app?

Rails developers usually interact with PostgreSQL via the Active Record ORM.

To do that, they place PostgreSQL connection details into the db/config.yml YAML configuration file, then add a Ruby postgres driver like the "pg" gem, which is responsible for establishing connections from the app to PostgreSQL.

Active Record creates an application-level connection pool to lazily open physical database connections to PostgreSQL. These are opened up and left idle when not in use for up to 5 minutes by default.

With that pool of connections available, Active Record Ruby writes and reads data to PostgreSQL.

Besides applications as "clients," teams might use CLI clients like psql or graphical clients like TablePlus or DBeaver.

Rails applications ship with a "[Rails Console](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html)" which is an enhanced version of the interactive Ruby interpreter REPL included with Ruby.

We can use the Rails Console to run snippets of Active Record code, and inspect the generated SQL.

For example we might run `User.find(1)` which would generate and execute a SQL query like `["SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1]`.

Active Record can do a lot of things before sending the query, such as annotating queries as [Query Logs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.0.4/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryLogs.html) which are comments that describe where the query was generated.

## What‚Äôs the ORM like? Any tips around setup?

Active Record is used in two major ways.

Most people think of the ORM usage that writes SQL queries from programming language code (Active Record in Ruby). The SQL queries either persist or retrieve data that populates in-memory Active Record object instances.

The ORM use is primarily Ruby classes as "models" in our application code, which could be business logic, that are then mapped to PostgreSQL table names. "Associations" in Active Record are used to link models together.

Active Record is pleasant to use as a Ruby programmer, just as the Ruby programming language is pleasant to use. They complement each other. Ruby and Active Record are more compact compared with SQL or more verbose programming languages like Java in my experience.

Active Record is one of the main reasons Rails developers like Rails.

While Active Record helpers are designed to allow developers to not write SQL, for developers do *do* wish to write SQL, that's also possible using Active Record. This can be quite handy to co-mingle SQL and Active Record code.

## Active Record for schema evolution management

Besides activing as an ORM, there's another primary use of Active Record, and that's as the schema management and evolution tool. This means we're writing Active Record to modify database objects, creating things like tables, indexes, or views.

Outside of Ruby on Rails, other communities might use tools like Flyway or Liquibase, or a tool that's built in to the web framework.

Active Record has a lot of nice helpers to perform DDL changes, and beyond that, there are lots of open source libraries that enhance Active Record further for "Migrations."

There is no concept of safe migrations though, which are migrations that take long locks and can block concurrent operations. Fortunately, open source libraries exist that can be easily added to achieve this.


## What‚Äôs the schema.rb vs structure.sql beef about?

In Active Record, the schema is represented as a text file that‚Äôs checked into source code control within the repository. This file represents the entire state of the database, and is a secondary file that‚Äôs derived from other smaller files that each represent an incremental change. These incremental change files are called "Migrations."

The text file may be a Ruby file or a SQL file. When PostgreSQL is used and the SQL format is chosen, the output file is generated from running `pg_dump` against the local application database.

The Ruby version is the default though, and is called `schema.rb`, and is 100% Ruby code. This file has maybe 90% of the information that the SQL version would have, so often in the course of an application, teams might *switch* to the SQL version to gain greater fidelity in how the database state is represented in file form.

For example, some database objects are not captured at all in the Ruby version of the file, such as database triggers. This can be a big problem when you're using those features, as newer instances of the application would have inconsistent database objects.

In those cases, developers need to extend the Ruby version capabilities, or switch to the SQL version.

For teams that aren‚Äôt used to working with `pg_dump` output, and mostly work exclusively with Ruby or serialization formats like YAML, adopting the SQL version might be a significant change for them, and they may push it off or avoid it.


## Any issues a DBA is more likely to see in a Postgres instance serving Rails-like applications?

The N+1 pattern can show up commonly from Active Record, which is an inefficient query pattern where repeated queries inside a loop can be rewritten to be a single query for multiple values.

This can result from not thinking about joins in the relational DB possibly, since developers are working in the object-oriented code paradigm, and not as much thinking about the queries being generated.

To generalize this a bit further, a DBA could see inefficient query plans being generated, which could come from inefficient schema design, misuse of features, or under-use of indexes. Another form of inefficient queries could be "SELECT *" when fewer columns would be adequate, not adding all the possible query restrictions to the WHERE clauses, or not adding a LIMIT and returning more rows than necessary. These aren‚Äôt limited to Ruby on Rails, but perhaps all ORM users can fall into these kinds of traps but not closely thinking about the SQL and without storing and accessing as little data as possible in each operation. 

Another common poor-performer at least < Postgres 14 is the "giant list of values in an IN clause." Performance for large amounts of values like 1000 or more was improved in PostgreSQL 14.

- <https://pganalyze.com/blog/5mins-postgres-performance-in-lists-vs-any-operator-bind-parameters>

James Coleman patch (copied from the 5min of Postgres links): <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=50e17ad28>

Benoit is also working with PostgreSQL contributor Peter G. on a certain type of query pattern with multiple WHERE clause conditions that causes an additional filtering step within an index scan, leading to poorly performing plans. This could happen in Active Record when chaining together multiple "where()" clause conditions.

Per Benoit, Peter says the fix going into PostgreSQL should ship in version 17, that can identify this scenario, and optimize the query plan to avoid the additional filtering step.

For `SELECT *` we can use an option in Active Record to enumerate all fields. This might make it more obvious for developers during development, that all fields are being fetched.

`config.active_record.enumerate_columns_in_select_statements` option described here: <https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/rails-7-adds-setting-for-enumerating-columns-in-select-statements>

This change in Active Record adds to the Active Record instrumentation events and warns about very large result sets being returned.

- <https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50887>

Nikolay pointed out that pg_stat_statements shows the rows returned as a stats column, which can also be used to identify opportunities to add more query restrictions or a LIMIT clause.

## Structural changes on live databases

Another big category DBAs might be surprised about is that Rails developers are "owning" the schema evolution, including making possible unsafe DDL changes.

For example, an index being added to a table that‚Äôs actively receiving writes, without adding hte index using the CONCURRENTLY option, and causing errors due to blocked writes. This can be detected by tools that force the use of CONCURRENTLY, and are added into the Migrations process for developers, but this doesn‚Äôt happen automatically with Ruby on Rails. As mentioned before, there‚Äôs no built-in concept of "safety."


## What‚Äôs the Rails + Postgres tooling ecosystem like? What are gems?

The Ruby open source shared library code ecosystem is very rich. In the book we cover more than 40 open source software items, with around 20 of those being Ruby gems that are added to the Rideshare application for examples and exercises throughout the book. These are Ruby gems that for the most part, I‚Äôve used in production apps at companies with significant scale, and they‚Äôve proven the test of time.

RubyGems are the mechanism in the Ruby language to package up and distribute code. They are built and hosted usually on rubygems.org. They are roughly equivalent to PostgreSQL extensions, in that they leverage extension points, and add functionality to the core.

Ruby gems that are helpful for running PostgreSQL apps range from "helpers" that developers can run to compare their application code and PostgreSQL database, for example rails-pg-extras, database_consistency, or others are mentioned in the book.
Another category would be gems that help avoid unsafe DDL changes, by adding a safety concept to migrations. These gems identify blocking operations in PostgreSQL and suggest non-blocking alternatives, such as creating indexes concurrently.

The book covers these gems or you can explore the Ruby Toolbox which has gems grouped into categories. https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/

## Any tips, or myths, around scaling?

I have some generic tips for creating high performance PostgreSQL queries.

Learn how to understand the costs of the components for a query, by regularly using the query planner. The planner provides this cost information, and your job as a developer is to lower the cost, mostly by adding well-placed indexes.

Once you can identify the costly parts, you can develop your bag of tricks for how to optimize parts which includes indexes and other tactics.

For myths, I think developers think that JOIN operations are very costly and should be avoided, which means that normalizing data may be avoided.

Brian Davis has a great post with benchmarks showing the cost of a join.[^5] The takeaway for me from that post was that the cost of a join is nominal and should not limit the use of good data normalization practices, even when tables grow to millions of rows and rows are being joined together from many tables at once.

[^5]: <https://www.brianlikespostgres.com/cost-of-a-join.html>

Nothing‚Äôs free though, and this does mean that a developer needs to create an efficient schema design with appropriate use of types, and create well-placed indexes that support the queries and join operations. For example, making sure that foreign keys are indexed, likely making good use of Multicolumn and Covering indexes, and using indexes to support ordering operations among other tactics.


Another myth is that PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt capable of certain kinds of work like full text search, caching, analytics, sharding, or background jobs, and adding in other non-relational companion databases is needed.

While this was more true 10 years ago with slower and smaller and more expensive disks, with SSDs and all the performance improvements to PostgreSQL over the last decade, this is not true today. In fact, often PostgreSQL is going heavily under-utilized in the overall workloads at businesses. This means they‚Äôre using a hodgepodge of database systems when PostgreSQL could handle all the needs.

Part of this is credited to how extensible PostgreSQL is, supporting many more data types and indexes and other capabilities beyond the core offering. If the core PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt sufficient for analytics or full text search, there are a variety of extensions that can be added to help serve these use cases, without needing to synchronize and operate additional databases.

## Is there anything you‚Äôd like to see from the Postgres community that would make things easier/better for Rails users?

I think web application developers really want to know which queries to optimize, and for that optimization process to be succinct and repeatable. PGSS (pg_stat_statements) is a great visibility tool but still lacks things like "samples". In PostgreSQL 16 we gained "generic plans" but samples with full query text would help.

I also gave a 5 minute lightning talk on some visibility tools at PGConf NYC. Michael and I collaborated on how to use the queryid "fingerprint" information that PostgreSQL gained in 14, to combine that with auto_explain information in 16 to get samples from the postgresql.log file, at least when the timing of a query exceeds a minimum.

- <https://speakerdeck.com/andyatkinson/pgconf-nyc-2023-lightning-talk>

Since PostgreSQL adds catalog views over time, maybe a new catalog view or an expanded existing catalog could contain query text samples for certain queries by their queryid identifier, or even collect samples based on different thresholds like "excessive buffers", excessive row counts, that we could then use to add those optimizations. A "max_samples" could be set so that old samples are removed.

## Post-show ideas/reflections/thoughts

For anyone interested in exploring a bit with Rails and PostgreSQL, the book uses a Rails application on GitHub called "Rideshare", throughout the book for examples and exercises. We didn‚Äôt mention this in the episode, but I wanted to mention it here. The application is public and available here: https://github.com/andyatkinson/rideshare

Within the source code directory, there‚Äôs a "postgresql" that has some goodies https://github.com/andyatkinson/rideshare/tree/main/postgresql like a .pgpass file to store the credentials, a config file for pgbouncer, and a postgresql sample config file with some of the changes made during exercises in the book.

We didn‚Äôt cover this, but the book examples all use the built-in command line PostgreSQL client "psql" exclusively. Since Rails developers are used to working with the Rails Console, I wanted to advocate for using the built-in CLI client psql.

There is a lot of content in the book that‚Äôs not related to Ruby on Rails at all. For example, SQL language functions, PL/pgSQL functions, shell scripts, table partitioning, full text search (with tsvector and tsquery), using Postgres as a message queue or for background jobs with LISTEN and NOTIFY, and some brief coverage of pgvector, and vector similarity searching.

##  More coverage of Active Record and PostgreSQL

We didn‚Äôt cover some of the breadth of support for PostgreSQL features in Active Record, so I wanted to add some of that in here in this section. These topics are all covered in the book.

Consider exploring the PostgreSQL page within the Active Record documentation for the current released major version - 7.1: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.1/active_record_postgresql.html>

- PostgreSQL Generated columns (Active Record virtual stored columns)
- Deferrable foreign keys support
- Check constraints
- Setting a Transaction isolation mode in Active Record
- Exclusion constraints
- Full text search using tsvector
- Database views
- Advanced Data types like Arrays and Ranges
- Query hint planning from Active Record, using `pg_hint_plan`. The book has an example of how to use this. 
- RETURNING clause, with INSERT (and possible other DML ops in the future)

## Errors

I mentioned Rails was used at DoorDash, but I don‚Äôt know if that's true.

I knew DoorDash used PostgreSQL in the past, but I could only find public writing about having used the Python Django framework.

The DoorDash engineering blog has some nice posts on production migration operations with PostgreSQL.
