I started learning tmux and highly recommend the book **_tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development_** [^book] as a guide. My `tmux.conf` [^conf] configuration file is available as well.

#### Keyboard Tips

  * `Ctrl-b` is the default prefix which I kept so that I could continue to use `Ctrl-a` to move the cursor to the front in bash and vim. 
  * On OS X I remapped my caps lock key to be the control key
  * `Ctrl-b z` can be used to toggle a pane into a window, and back to a pane. 
  * To scroll back through output `Ctrl-b [` enters copy mode. I use vim navigation to move around (`Ctrl-u` and `Ctrl-d` up and down 1/2 page, `Shift j/k` to move a line at a time). If I know I need to read back though, I usually tail the log file in a separate terminal window and use the mouse since I find it to be faster.

#### Shortcuts

 * `tmux ls` when detached, lists any running tmux sessions. `tmux attach -t X` can be used to attach to an existing session, where X is the number of the session.
 * `Ctrl-b d` detaches from an existing session
 * `Ctrl-b c` creates a new window within a session. `exit` will close the window. `Ctrl-b ,` (comma) can be used to rename the window.
 * To split a window into panes, following the guidelines the book recommends, the shortcut `Ctrl-b |` (pipe) splits the window vertically into two panes next to each other, while `Ctrl-b -` (hyphen) splits the window into two panes stacked on top of each other horizontally. To move back and forth between panes `Ctrl-b h/j/k/l` can be used, or to apply a new layout entirely to the panes within a window, `Ctrl-b spacebar` can be used.
 * `Ctrl-b w` displays a list of the open windows, and the h/j/k/l keys can be used to move up and down the list. `Ctrl-b X` where X is a number can be used to jump to a specific numbered window.


#### Issues

One of the issues when resizing a window from a small size to a large size is that dots would be drawn around the main content area. Detaching and re-attaching to the window seems to fix it. [^1]

At this time it is not possible to give names to panes within windows. I tried having multiple applications running with their log file being tailed, one application per pane within a window, but it became too difficult to tell what application was running in a given pane. As a workaround I mostly limit a window to a single running application, and don't use multiple panes.
