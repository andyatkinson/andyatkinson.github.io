I had the chance to join Drew Bragg on his podcast "Code and the Coding Coders who Code It" and we had a great conversation.

Primarily we talked about my experience over the last year writing a PostgreSQL book aimed at Ruby on Rails developers.

üëâ [Episode 27 - Andrew Atkinson](https://podcast.drbragg.dev/episodes/episode-27-andrew-atkinson/)

## Outline

* Book Promotion
* Writing and Coding
* Book Writing
* Balancing Book, Job, Family Commitments
* Technical Topics (Rails)

I met Drew in person at Sin City Ruby 2022 in Las Vegas where he presented *Who Wants to Be a Ruby Engineer?*. Drew's presentation was filled with Ruby trivia and he used a game show style for it and made it really fun.

For his podcast, Drew does a 3-question format that's familiar to software developers.

The questions are: What are you currently working on? Do you have any current blockers? What's something you're currently excited about?

Let's dive in.

## Book Promotion

Part of my goal with the podcast was to promote my upcoming book launch: [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](https://pgrailsbook.com).

For one more week I'm sending out summaries of 10 Ruby gems and PostgreSQL extensions mentioned in the book. Subscribers will also get an exclusive discount code from the publisher once the book launches in Beta on August 30, 2023.

If that interests you, please subscribe at üëâ [pgrailsbook.com](https://pgrailsbook.com).

Besides the book, we got into a variety of other topics like writing and editing technical books, and similarities between writing code and prose.

## Writing and Coding

Writing code and writing books have some shared design goals.

* Aim for High cohesion
* Aim for Low coupling

High cohesion in software code means the class or object has a narrow scope. Things in the class go together. In prose a "chapter" should also have clear and single subject matter and all the sections that relate to the chapter.

"Low coupling" when describing objects and classes, refers to how they should have dependencies to other classes or objects.

Similarly for prose and Chapters, there shouldn't be a lot of back and forward references that couple the chapter to other chapters. This is something I learned in the process thanks to the editor Don!

Chapters should stand on their own but also contribute to the overall purpose of the book.

## Book Writing

Regarding writing the book, we didn't discuss this as much in the podcast, but there are a number of other similarities to software development.

* With Pragmatic Programmers, book is managed like source code written in Markdown and XML, and checked in to the Subversion version control system
* Command line programs are provided and used to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù PDF versions of the book, and there is a continuous integration server
* In my personal workflow, I use the [Vale command line program](/blog/2023/05/26/better-writing-vale) for spell checking and grammar checking

The flow of these writing tools can feel similar to writing code.

## Balancing Book, Job, Family

Around the 25 minute mark, we dove more into how the book writing has impacted my personal life.

Drew asked about how I managed the book responsibilities, a full-time job, family responsibilities, and my own personal mental and physical health.

The truth is that over the last year at times it has been a struggle to keep these responsibilities in balance.

I‚Äôve also let my personal health slide a bit and as the book writing and editing load has lessened, I'm looking to get reinvest more into my personal health and relationships.

## Technical Topics

In the last section about something I think is cool, we decided to mention a couple of things in the book I learned about that are broadly applicable to Rails developers.

* [Prosopite](https://github.com/charkost/prosopite) - This is a Ruby gem for N+1 detection. Prosopite can be configured to detect the N+1 query pattern.
* [Strict Loading](https://rubyonrails.org/2020/2/21/this-week-in-rails-strict-loading-in-active-record-and-more) mode in Active Record. Strict Loading can be used to prevent Lazy Loading and require Eager Loading data. This makes the N+1 query pattern impossible.

See: [PGSQL Phriday #001 ‚Äî Query Stats, Log Tags, and N+1s](/blog/2022/10/07/pgsqlphriday-2-truths-lie) for more details on Strict Loading.

Thanks!
