In the Staff Engineer book, there is a guide covering [Work on What Matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters) which I thought had good advice for how to prioritize work.

Like any advice there are exceptions, but I found it helpful how they described the relationship between effort and impact.


### Avoid Snacking

"Snacking" is basically easy, low-impact work. Some things that came to mind in Ruby on Rails web development were:

* Updating a minor or patch version of a gem dependency
* Updating a patch version of Rails
* Adopting a new well documented API

These things have value, but they are also easy and probably lower in impact. As the guide says, snack sized work is good to fill in gaps or could be good for hand off to someone with less experience looking to make a contribution.

Just like in real life a diet should not consist solely of snacks.


### Stop Preening

Preening I had not heard before but is basically also low impact like snacking, but instead of low visibility it's high-visibility work.

This made me think of taking on a pet project for the boss. It might be highly visible work which could be useful to help build trust, but it may not benefit an individual's growth much.

The author encourages the reader to strike a balance between valued work and self growth.


### Chasing Ghosts

Ghosts are low-impact but very high effort projects that aren't quite done and a new person may be brought in to try and solve.

> Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results.


### What should you work on? Existential issues.


Running out of money is an example listed. Another example listed was something we discussed recently, we'd scaled vertically to the largest instance class available for the DB server, and there was concern additional load would exceed capacity.

Since there was no additional purchaseable headroom available, working on code and data solutions internally to optimize further while not a guaranteed future crisis, was a possible one, and therefore it was easier to sell the engineering effort involved in working on that.



### Work where this is room and attention

The guide suggests working where there is both room to work (things to be done, not fully solved), and attention to the work.

This makes sense to me. Bringing someone in new but with nothing really to do, is unproductive. Bringing someone in new to work on something that has been ignored for a long time, will probably result in their effort being ignored.

* What might become priorities in the future where you can work in advance of that?
* Areas that are ok, but could be great
* Be mindful of working in a company area that is not well supported


### More Ideas

* Foster growth
* Edit
* Finish things
* What only you can

This made sense to me and I've seen this before. A lot of projects are mostly there but not fully released.
