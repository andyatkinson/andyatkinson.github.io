A quick look at two Microservice Frameworks for Java.

## Dropwizard

[Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io) is a lightweight (for Java) [^1] framework to build microservice back-ends with Java.

I became aware of Dropwizard as an engineer at Groupon, where it used heavily as the basis for the official method of developing Java microservices. I know from a previous colleague it was used at HubSpot as well. Perhaps at other startups that started as a Rails monolithic app, reached a certain scale, and were broken up into microservices. The Ruby-to-Java history is discussed here [^2] with the Coda Hale and Yammer background. This slide [^3] shows roughly equivalent Rails and Dropwizard functionality for those coming from Rails.

I made a [Hello World Dropwizard App](https://github.com/andyatkinson/dropwizard-hello-world) to get a sense for developing with it, and [deployed it to Heroku](https://hello-world-dropwizard.herokuapp.com/hello-world?name=andy). I found Dropwizard to be ok to use, maybe not sparking the "Joy" of Sinatra and Ruby, but relatively lightweight for Java, and with very fast performance.


## Javalin

[Javalin](https://javalin.io/) is described as:

> A simple web framework for Java and Kotlin

I made a [Hello World App with Javalin](https://github.com/andyatkinson/javalin-hello-world) and [deployed it on Heroku](https://javalin-hello-world-andy.herokuapp.com/), as a comparison with Dropwizard, in search of the lightest weight Java web framework.

I found it easy to use, and having even less code and setup compared with Dropwizard. For a very small API, if I was using Java, I'd consider implementing it with Javalin. If I was starting from scratch, I'd probably choose Kotlin over Java as well!

#### Wrapping Up

There are loads more Java microservice frameworks out there. What is your favorite one and why?
