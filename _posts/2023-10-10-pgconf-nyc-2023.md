Just got back from the whirlwind üå™Ô∏è of [PGConf NYC 2023](https://2023.pgconf.nyc) in Midtown Manhattan.üóΩ After [presenting at the 2021 edition](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021)), which was my first ever PostgreSQL conference, I was excited to return because of the great experience the first time around.

This time, I'm happy to report that my experience was the same or even better than the first one.

It was a great week of learning, networking, and sharing! There is something magical about getting so many different PostgreSQL people together in a shared space, that's hard to replicate online.

Choosing sessions was difficult, since there were 3 tracks to choose from.

The PostgreSQL ecosystem is broad, and includes established companies and startups using it, and new companies building on top of it. And of course there are direct contributors presenting and attending.

## Outline

* Recap of sessions I attended
* Networking with big companies using PostgreSQL
* Networking with PostgreSQL users and backend engineers
* Developer Advocates and Community Builders like Ryan Booz, Joe Brockmeier
* Networking with PostgreSQL committers and major contributors
* Startups, Sponsors, and Vendors
* Lightning Talks

## Networking with PostgreSQL users

I met backend engineers from these companies, using PostgreSQL!

- [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com)
- [Hinge](https://hinge.co)
- [Brex](https://www.brex.com)

These companies have dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of PostgreSQL instances, powering their platforms.

Fleet management, configuration management, zero downtime cutovers, and major version upgrades are big challenges these companies face. We also face these challenges but to a lesser extent.

There are also opportunities to meet presenters.

I met Performance and Scalability enthusiasts Hamid Akhtar and Umair Shahid. I met Samay S. who presented at [Citus Con 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8rAOgDdH1U) earlier this year.

## Networking with PostgreSQL committers

The conference provides a great opportunity to meet contributors, committers, and community members. I briefly met Robert H. and Andreas F.

* And contributors Jonathan K., Melanie P.
* Popular open source projects like pgbouncer, citus: Jelte F.

Community members Robert Treat.

Check out the [Contributor Profiles](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/) page.

This page categorizes the Core Team, Major Contributors, Contributors, and past Hackers Emeritus and Contributors.

## PostgreSQL Startups

These are new companies building on and contributing to the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

- [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so)
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io)
- [Neon](https://neon.tech)
- OtterTune
- pgEdge

Many of these companies are sponsors, and had booths where you could learn about their products and offerings.

## Lightning Talks

I was excited to give a short lightning talk, and enjoyed the ~10 lightning talks given by others.

I briefly showed a PostgreSQL 16 feature that adds the Query Identifier to logged query execution plans.

If there's interest, I can record this demo since the original wasn't recorded.

## Hanging Out

Had some fun dinners and events out in NYC to meet more folks.

Highlights included Dim Sum, Italian in the East Village, and a private Karaoke room where we belted out tunes!

## Wrap Up

PostgreSQL NYC was a great conference to network, learn, and share. The organizers and volunteers did a great job running it, creating a great experience for attendees.

If you're considering attending a future PGConf or PGDay event (see: [PGDay Chicago 2023](/blog/2023/05/24/pgday-chicago), I recommend them!
