Just got back from the whirlwind üå™Ô∏è of [PGConf NYC 2023](https://2023.pgconf.nyc) in Midtown Manhattan.üóΩüèôüçé After [presenting at the 2021 edition](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021)), my first PostgreSQL conference, I was excited to return.

I'd learned a lot. The session quality was high, and the attendee size was manageable.

This time around I'm happy to share I had the same or an even better experience.

It was a great week of learning, networking, and sharing! There is something magical about getting so many different PostgreSQL people together in a shared space, that's hard to replicate online.

Choosing sessions was difficult, since there were 3 tracks to choose from.

The PostgreSQL ecosystem is broad, and includes established companies using it, startups, and new startup companies building on top of it. And of course there are direct contributors presenting and attending.

## Outline

* Recap of sessions I attended
* Networking with industry folks (AWS, Microsoft, Crunchy Data, [Tembo](https://tembo.io))
* Networking with big PostgreSQL users in the industry: Instacart, Hinge, Brex
* Developer Advocates and Community Builders like Ryan Booz, Joe Brockmeier
* Networking with PostgreSQL committers and major contributors (Jonathan, [Melanie P.](https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2023/sessions/speaker/214-melanie-plageman/))
* Startups: [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so), [Tembo](https://tembo.io), Neon
* Lightning talks!

## Networking with PostgreSQL users

- [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com)
- [Hinge](https://hinge.co)
- [Brex](https://www.brex.com)

These organizations have developers running dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of PostgreSQL instances.

Fleet management, configuration management, zero downtime cutovers and major version upgrades are big challenges these companies face. We face similar challenges to a lesser extent.

Meeting PostgreSQL Performance and Scalability enthusiasts Hamid Akhtar and Umair Shahid was great.

## Networking with PostgreSQL committers

The conference provides a great opportunity to meet contributors, committers, and community members. I briefly met Robert H. and Andreas F.

* And contributors Jonathan K., [Melanie P.](https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2023/sessions/speaker/214-melanie-plageman/))
* Popular open source projects pgbouncer, and citus: Jelte F.

Check out the [Contributor Profiles](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/) page.

This page categorizes the Core Team, Major Contributors, Contributors, and past Hackers Emeritus and Contributors.

## PostgreSQL Startups

These are new companies building on and contributing to the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

- [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so)
- [Tembo](https://tembo.io)
- [Neon](https://neon.tech)
- OtterTune
- pgEdge

Many of these companies are sponsors, and had booths where you could learn about their products and offerings.

## Lightning Talks

I was excited to give a short lightning talk, and enjoyed the ~10 lightning talks given by others.

I briefly showed a PostgreSQL 16 feature that adds the Query Identifier to logged query execution plans.

If there's interest, I can record this demo since the original wasn't recorded.

## Hanging Out

Had some fun dinners and events out in NYC to meet more folks.

Highlights included Dim Sum, Italian in the East Village, and a private Karaoke room where we belted out tunes!

## Wrap Up

PostgreSQL NYC was a great conference to network, learn, and share. I recommend it!
