Just got back from the whirlwind of [PGConf NYC 2023](https://2023.pgconf.nyc) in Midtown Manhattan. After [presenting at the 2021 edition](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021)), my first PostgreSQL conference, I was excited to return. It was a great week of learning, networking, and sharing! There is something magical about bringing so many different PostgreSQL people together in a shared space for a short time.

Choosing sessions was difficult, since there were 3 tracks to choose from.

The PostgreSQL ecosystem is broad, including established companies, startups using PostgreSQL, startups building on top of PostgreSQL, and of course direct contributors presenting and attending.

## Outline

* Recap of sessions I attended
* Networking with industry folks (AWS, Microsoft, Crunchy Data, [Tembo](https://tembo.io))
* Networking with big PostgreSQL users in the industry: Instacart, Hinge, Brex
* Developer Advocates and Community Builders like Ryan Booz Joe Brockmeier
* Networking with PostgreSQL committers and major contributors (Jonathan, [Melanie P.](https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2023/sessions/speaker/214-melanie-plageman/))
* Startups: [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so), [Tembo](https://tembo.io), Neon
* Lightning talks!

## Networking with PostgreSQL users

* [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com), [Hinge](https://hinge.co), [Brex](https://www.brex.com)

Great to hear about from organizations running 100s or even thousands of instances.

One suggestion I have is more talks on fleet management, configuration management, zero downtime cutovers and major version upgrades.

These seem like common challenges companies face when operating many PostgreSQL instances, possibly without dedicated DBAs.

Meeting PostgreSQL Performance and Scalability enthusiasts Hamid Akhtar and Umair Shahid was great.

## Networking with PostgreSQL committers

Great opportunity to meet direct committers. Briefly met Robert H. and Andreas F.

* And contributors Jonathan K., [Melanie P.](https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2023/sessions/speaker/214-melanie-plageman/))
* Popular open source projects pgbouncer, and citus: Jelte F.

## PostgreSQL Startups

These are new companies building on and contributing to the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

Startups: [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so), [Tembo](https://tembo.io), [Neon](https://neon.tech), OtterTune, pgEdge

## Lightning Talks

I briefly showed a PostgreSQL 16 feature that adds the Query Identifier to logged query execution plans.

If there's interest, I can record this demo again since the Lightning Talk wasn't recorded.

## Hanging Out

Had some fun dinners out to meet more folks. Highlights included Dim Sum, Italian in the East Village, and a private Karaoke room.

## Wrap Up

PostgreSQL NYC is a great conference to network, learn, and share. I recommend it!
