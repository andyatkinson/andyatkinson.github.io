I recently attended [PGConf NYC 2023](https://2023.pgconf.nyc) (aside: [I presented at the 2021 edition](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021)) in midtown Manhattan. It was a great week of learning, networking, and sharing!

This post recaps my experience and has a lot of links for you to explore. Check out the sessions I attended, some PostgreSQL companies and startups, and some of the folks I was able to network with.

## Networking with PostgreSQL users

* Instacart, Hinge, Brex

Great to hear about from organizations running 100s of instances.

One suggestion I have for conference organizers is to request more talks on fleet management, configuration management, zero downtime cutovers and upgrades.

When managing more than a couple of instances, modern Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tools become critical. Major version upgrades are also still a pain, at least for operators that perform them infrequently.

This was discussed in the Upgrades episodes of postgres.fm.

## Networking with PostgreSQL committers

Great opportunity to meet direct committers.

* And major contributors (Jonathan, [Melanie](https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2023/sessions/speaker/214-melanie-plageman/))
* Popular open source like pgbouncer, and the citus extension: Jelte

## PostgreSQL Startups

These are new companies building on and contributing to the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

* Hydra, Tembo, Neon, pgEdge

## Lightning talk!

* Query Identifier in auto_explain explain plans in PostgreSQL 16
