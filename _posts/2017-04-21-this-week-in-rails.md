"This Week in Rails" is a weekly newsletter, started by [Godfrey Chan](https://twitter.com/chancancode), that covers a week's worth of interesting changes to the Ruby on Rails framework.

I have been helping write issues since 2015, and I wanted to share my story and some thoughts about becoming an editor.

### A brief history

After Godfrey became a regular Rails contributor, [he started a side project](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/2017/04/09/an-incredible-journey) to write about changes in Rails each week. The first issue was written over 3 years ago in March 2014, and had 14 recipients. Since then, a team of editors has formed, creating new issues each week, being delivered to over 7000 subscribers!

I was a reader of the newsletter and attended a talk Godfrey gave at the Rubynation conferece. I met him briefly after his talk, and followed up by email, expressing my interest in helping out. Soon after I was scheduled to co-write an issue!

### Distributed team and mentorship

After getting in touch, I learned there was a team of editors that write the issues. I was paired up with [Marcel](https://twitter.com/marcelmorgan), and we co-wrote an issue, after learning the tools and the process he generally followed. Later on, I paired up with [Greg](https://twitter.com/gregmolnar) for another issue before striking out on my own.

I think the distributed team (many countries and timezones) works because of the tools, but also because the mentorship approach for new editors, serves as a great way to onboard new editors.


### Mangement style

Godfrey has a jovial writing style, and manages the newsletter and team in a similar way. Each editor can put their personal touch on the issue they're writing, but there is also some consistency with each issue. Generally a lot of responsibility is left up to the author, which I found worked well, and it's nice to have a team of people to reach out to for help.

### Writing style

Since we're writing about code, for programmers, as programmers, the content can be a little dry. The writing style is more upbeat though, and doesn't take things too seriously. Having a theme is nice. I've taken inspiration from holidays, or world events, but it can be a challenge to come up something interesting or fun. The nuts and bolts of the issue are to find interesting Pull Requests, particularly with comments and context, or bug fixes and features with a broad impact. We also like to highlight the number of contributors, and call out first-time contributors, to help get these individuals some recognition for their hard work.

### Technical details

 * Basecamp for document storage, schedule, chat
 * Goodbits for the newsletter itself
 * Github, duh!
