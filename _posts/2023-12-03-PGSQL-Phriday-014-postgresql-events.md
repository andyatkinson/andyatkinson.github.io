This post is my contribution to the [PGSQL Phriday #014 blog post series](https://www.pgsqlphriday.com/2023/11/pgsql-phriday-014/). Here's the invitation:

> I invite you to share your PostgreSQL Events experiences in your dedicated blog post. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned attendee, a speaker, a trainer, a sponsor, an organizer, or a first-timer, your unique perspective contributes to the canvas of the PostgreSQL community.

Since I didn't have a lot of time for this one, I decided to make a list of the events I've either attended myself, or have on my radar. I hoped others might find the list useful or interesting.

## PostgreSQL Events I've Attended

I‚Äôve attended three official PostgreSQL events, as well as PostgreSQL sessions at AWS re:Invent 2022 and PostgreSQL User Groups (virtually).

Here are links blog posts I wrote about those experiences:

* PGConf NYC 2021 (See: [PGConf NYC 2021 Conference](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021))
* AWS re:Invent 2022 (See: [AWS re:Invent Day 1](/blog/2022/11/28/aws-reinvent-day1))
* PgDay Chicago 2023 (See: [PGDay Chicago 2023 Conference](/blog/2023/05/24/pgday-chicago))
* PGConf NYC 2023 (See: [PGConf NYC 2023 Recap üêò](/blog/2023/10/10/pgconf-nyc-2023))

For Upcoming PostgreSQL events, check out: [Upcoming Events](https://www.postgresql.org/about/events/)


## Attendees and their jobs and roles
Prior to attending PostgreSQL events, I wondered what the backgrounds were for people that attend. Do they all work as DBAs?

From my experience in conversations and observations, attendees tend to work as:
* DBAs
* Database engineers
* Developer relations, developer advocates, community advocates
* Engineers that work on database **Products**
* Backend engineers for product or services companies, that **use** PostgreSQL, likely at a higher scale, or with a large fleet of instances


## Types of companies
Which companies are represented at these events?

* Big companies and cloud providers: AWS, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Google, Crunchy Data
* Timescale, YugabyteDB
* Startup companies with database or commercial extension products like: Tembo, Neon, Hydra
* Database services and products: DBTune, OtterTune, Redgate Software
* Companies that offer expert consulting and products: EDB, PGX

## Why go?
If you're considering attending an event, what are some benefits you might get?

* Learn how you can better use PostgreSQL in your job
* Expand your knowledge of companies and products in the PostgreSQL ecosystem
* Network with folks in the industry at these companies, or who work in the types of roles listed above
* Learn about internals of PostgreSQL and database systems
* Learn how you could contribute to PostgreSQL

## In-person and virtual events

PostgreSQL events are a mix of in-person and virtual events.

* Can't beat in-person events for high bandwidth in-person networking
* Can't beat virtual events for *accessibility* and location independence. Check out events like: [Citus Con](https://www.citusdata.com/cituscon/2023/)

## Vendor events
PostgreSQL companies offer lots of events throughout the year. Here are some:

- [Neon developer days](https://devdays.neon.tech)
- [Planet Scale events](https://planetscale.com/events): Sharding/MySQL Vitess Webinar
- [pganalyze webinars](https://pganalyze.com/resources)


## Calls for proposals
Try submitting a proposal to a conference! It's a good learning experience regardless of acceptance.

- Conferences love to bring in first-time presenters
- Presentations are a great way to showcase your work
- Preparing for presentations can help deepen your knowledge and skills, by being forced to organize the information for educational purposes.


## PostgreSQL conferences on my radar
- PgDay Chicago
- [SCALE 21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x) LA, CA
- [PgDay Paris](https://2023.pgday.paris)
- [PostgreSQL Conference Europe](https://2023.pgconf.eu)
- [PGCon 2024](https://www.pgcon.org/2024/)
- [Postgres Conference 2024](https://postgresconf.org)


## PostgreSQL User Groups
Here are some of the PostgreSQL User Group events I've been involved with or would like to be in the future:
- [SF Pug](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SFPUG)
- [pgCMH](https://www.meetup.com/postgrescmh/), Columbus Ohio PUG
- [Seattle Postgres](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-postgres/) (Organizing team: Jeremy S.)
- [Kansas City Postgres User Group](https://www.meetup.com/kansas-city-postgres-user-group/) (Organizing team: Elizabeth C.)
- [Chicago PostgreSQL Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-postgresql-user-group/) (Organizing team: Henrietta D.)


## Non-PostgreSQL conferences on my radar
As a Ruby on Rails and backend web application developer, there are many non-PostgreSQL conferences on my radar.

Here's a sampling of some of them:

* [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com)
* [RailsConf](https://www.railsconf.org) (in 2024 it be in Detroit)
* [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org) US (recently happened in San Diego)
* [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world) (recently in Amsterdam, in 2024 it will be held in Toronto)
* [Sin City Ruby 2024](https://www.sincityruby.com): Held in Las Vegas. I‚Äôll be presenting!

## Post-Event Reflections

One section of the PGSQL Invitation asked whether folks had post-event reflections or specific rituals.

I have a couple of things I like to do after I attend events:

- I take notes during the event, which aren‚Äôt organized. Afterwards, I read them and organize them, possibly into a blog post. Besides the organizational benefits, this process provides an opportunity for me to gather more context on the details, like specific technologies and people.
- I try to connect with attendees I met in person on social media and LinkedIn as soon as possible. I'll include a reminder about how we met or something we talked about, since attendees might be meeting a lot of people. This is a nice opportunity to investigate their company or background.
- I'll try and take away 1-2 topics I want to learn about in more depth in the future. Recently I did that for [`pg_stat_io`](/blog/2023/11/01/PostgreSQL-IO-Visibility-wehack-pg_stat_io) following PGConf NYC, where I wanted to learn about how to use it and how it could be useful to me in the future.

## Wrap Up

PostgreSQL events have generally been well run, and have provided opportunities to learn, network, and grow as an engineer. I recommend them! Send me questions if you have them.

Thanks!
