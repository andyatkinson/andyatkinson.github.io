This post is my contribution to the PGSQL Phriday #014 blog post series. Here's the invitation for #014:

> I invite you to share your PostgreSQL Events experiences in your dedicated blog post. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned attendee, a speaker, a trainer, a sponsor, an organizer, or a first-timer, your unique perspective contributes to the canvas of the PostgreSQL community.

For my post, since I didn't have a lot of time for this one, I decided to make a bullet point list of events with minimal commentary. While lacking in details, I hoped others might find the list useful to look through.

## Overview of PostgreSQL Events

I‚Äôve had the privilege of presenting and attending three official PostgreSQL events in the last couple of years, as well as PostgreSQL sessions at AWS re:Invent 2022, and PostgreSQL User Group meetups.

Here are some of the bigger scale events:

* PGConf NYC 2021 (See: [PGConf NYC 2021 Conference](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021))
* AWS re:Invent 2022 (See: [AWS re:Invent Day 1](/blog/2022/11/28/aws-reinvent-day1))
* PgDay Chicago 2023 (See: [PGDay Chicago 2023 Conference](/blog/2023/05/24/pgday-chicago))
* PGConf NYC 2023 (See: [PGConf NYC 2023 Recap üêò](/blog/2023/10/10/pgconf-nyc-2023))

See: [Upcoming Events](https://www.postgresql.org/about/events/)


## Attendees and their jobs and roles
What are common job roles and responsibilities for attendees of these events?

This is my anecdotal experience from conversations and observations:

Attendees tend to work as:
* DBAs
* Database engineers
* Developer relations, developer advocates, community advocates
* Work for database vendors, maybe as experts, solution engineers, or on teams that build database products


## Types of companies
What are some of the companies at these events?

* Big companies and cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Google, Crunchy Data
* Timescale, YugabyteDB
* Startup companies making commercial extensions like database offerings like Tembo, Neon
* Database services: DBTune, OtterTune
* Consultancies: EDB, PgExperts

## Why go?
If you're considering any of these events, you might be wondering whether it's worth going or why?

* Learn how to better use PostgreSQL for your job
* Expand your knowledge of companies and products in the PostgreSQL ecosystem, that may offer solutions for you, or may offer job or partnership opportunities
* Network with industry professionals

## In-person and virtual

* Can't beat in-person for networking
* Nice virtual events too like [Citus Con](https://www.citusdata.com/cituscon/2023/)
