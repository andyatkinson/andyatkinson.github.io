This post is my contribution to the PGSQL Phriday #014 blog post series. Here's the invitation:

> I invite you to share your PostgreSQL Events experiences in your dedicated blog post. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned attendee, a speaker, a trainer, a sponsor, an organizer, or a first-timer, your unique perspective contributes to the canvas of the PostgreSQL community.

Since I didn't have a lot of time for this one, I decided to make a list of events I've attended or have on my radar in the community, and hoped that others would find the list useful or interesting.

## Overview of PostgreSQL Events

I‚Äôve attended three official PostgreSQL events in the last couple of years. Besides those, I've attended PostgreSQL sessions at AWS re:Invent 2022 and PostgreSQL User Groups.

Here are links to events with posts:

* PGConf NYC 2021 (See: [PGConf NYC 2021 Conference](/blog/2021/12/06/pgconf-nyc-2021))
* AWS re:Invent 2022 (See: [AWS re:Invent Day 1](/blog/2022/11/28/aws-reinvent-day1))
* PgDay Chicago 2023 (See: [PGDay Chicago 2023 Conference](/blog/2023/05/24/pgday-chicago))
* PGConf NYC 2023 (See: [PGConf NYC 2023 Recap üêò](/blog/2023/10/10/pgconf-nyc-2023))

## Attendees and their jobs and roles
What are common job roles and responsibilities for attendees of these events?

From my experience in conversations and observations, attendees tend to work as:
* DBAs
* Database engineers
* Developer relations, developer advocates, community advocates
* Engineers on database projects
* Backend engineers for product or services companies


## Types of companies
Which companies are represented at these events?

* Big companies and cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Google, Crunchy Data)
* Timescale, YugabyteDB
* Startup companies with databases or commercial extensions and offerings: Tembo, Neon, Hydra
* Database services: DBTune, OtterTune, Redgate Software

## Why go?
Here are some reasons to attend:

* Learn how to use PostgreSQL better for your day job
* Expand your knowledge of companies and products in the PostgreSQL ecosystem
* Network with industry professionals

## In-person and virtual

* Can't beat in-person events for networking
* There are nice virtual events for learning too like [Citus Con](https://www.citusdata.com/cituscon/2023/)

## Vendor events
PostgreSQL companies have lots of events you could attend. Here are a few:

- [Neon developer days](https://devdays.neon.tech)
- [Planet Scale events](https://planetscale.com/events): Sharding/MySQL Vitess Webinar

## Calls for proposals
- Try submitting one!
- Conferences love to bring in first-time presenters
- Presentations are a great way to showcase your work as a case study
- Preparing for presentations has helped me deepen my knowledge and skills on specific topics like table partitioning.
