## Win a signed copy at EuRuKo or Rails World!

Win a signed copy of [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](/pgrailsbook) in September. Must be present to win.

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¦ We'll have two signed copies given away at EuRuKo, the European Ruby conference, facilitated by my friend and presenter Karen Jex.

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ And I'll personally be handing out around 5 copies at Rails World in Toronto, Canada.
