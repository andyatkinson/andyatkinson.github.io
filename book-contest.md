## Win a signed copy at EuRuKo or Rails World!

Win a signed copy of [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](/pgrailsbook) in September. Must be present to win.

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¦ We'll have two signed copies given away at EuRuKo, the European Ruby conference, facilitated by my friend and [presenter Karen Jex](https://x.com/andatki/status/1825864383320215784). (See Karen's talk: [Optimising your database for analytics](https://2024.euruko.org/speakers/karen_jex))

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ And I'll personally be handing out around 5 copies at [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/) in Toronto, Canada.
