## Watch, Subscribe, and Win

We've got 3 codes for free ebook copies of [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](/pgrailsbook) to give away, and wanted to run a contest for a couple of weeks to generate some buzz.

Who's this for? This contest is meant for people that weren't able to attend Rails World 2024, but are interested in watching recorded sessions that are now available, and are generally interested in the book.

</div>

## How to enter

1. Watch one or more of the [Rails World 2024 recorded sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw&list=PLHFP2OPUpCeb182aDN5cKZTuyjn3Tdbqx). Take note of something you liked.

1. Subscribe **and make sure to confirm** at [pgrailsbook.com](https://pgrailsbook.com), which is a newsletter I send out about once per month, with Postgres and Rails content. I hope you'll stay as a subscriber, but technically you just need to be subscribed as part of your contest entry.

1. Once you've subscribed and confirmed, send me a message with your favorite session, or what you liked, and let me know you'd like to be entered. Mention your email address you used to subscribe. [Contact me via this form](/contact), on social media DMs, or by email at contact@pgrailsbook.com.

Once you've done that:

1. Look for a reply from me confirming that you're entered.
1. I'll do draw three winners and email their codes on November 1st.

You've got until October 31st to enter.

Good luck and thanks for participating!

P.S. If you can't wait, there's also a 40% off discount code `RailsWorld2024` for any Rails book over at [pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com).
