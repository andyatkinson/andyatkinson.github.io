### Past Projects
From 2009 until 2013 I worked on two iPhone applications for Minneapolis and St. Paul Minnesota bus and train riders. We formed a team called "Beetle Fight" and sold [bus brain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/BusBrain) and [train brain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/TrainBrain) in the App Store for $1/each. The bus and train schedule data was served via a Rails application called [transit](https://github.com/andyatkinson/transit). We are no longer running the applications so they have been open sourced. 

[jquery-tweets](https://github.com/andyatkinson/jquery-tweets) was a jQuery plugin to load tweets for a website and display them in a variety of ways. Twitter made an API change that is incompatible with how this plugin fetched data.
