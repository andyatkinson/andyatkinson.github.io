## Hello!

This is the source code for my website, blog, and portfolio at [andyatkinson.com](https://andyatkinson.com) built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.


#### Writing Style Tips

Use [Vale](https://vale.sh)! [How I use it](/blog/2023/05/26/better-writing-vale)

 * Use `h4` for headings
 * Add tags to the post
 * In Vim `:set wrap`/`:set nowrap` to enable/disable soft wrap
 * In Vim `leader-s` enables spell check mode, check spelling, add words with `zg` [Vim Spell Checking](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/vim-spell-checking) by Thoughtbot
 * Use initial caps in post titles
 * Use `<mark/>` to highlight a section
 * Use footnotes when appropriate
 * For blockquotes, add a `<cite/>`
 * On macOS, preview with MacDown [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) The open source Markdown editor for macOS.
 * For section headings, use caps
 * For product and company names, mind the CamelCase
 * For dates on posts, use a date and not a time
 * Bare markdown links are `<>`
 * Using footnotes: make a `[^footnote]` usage where you want it inserted, and a `[^footnote]: Text <link>` at the bottom of the article

#### Theme Bugs and Issues

~~The `include` for the social link icons does not work on Heroku but worked locally. The `icons` folder is nested one layer deeper and it may just be that the relative filepath is not working.~~
This was worked around for now by inlining the contents of the `include`.

Multi-word tags had a whitespace character after the hyphen. Removed that so URLs worked.

`site.baseurl` did not have a leading slash in `_layouts/post.html` and did elsewhere, so this was breaking links. For now I manually inserted the leading slash in that file.

#### Development

    bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental

I occasionally `rm -rf _site` to remove the generated site completely. Changing `config.yml` requires restarting the development server.
