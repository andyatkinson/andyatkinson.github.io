### Code In Place 2021

As a Section Leader for [Code In Place 2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), I met weekly with up to 10 learners over 5 weeks learning Computer Science for the first time. We spent an hour together reviewing lecture concepts, lecture exercises and assignment problems.

We used Stanford's Karel robot with Python to learn some foundational concepts, and covered a number of fun topics like accepting user input, image manipulation and data structures. Section Leaders were supported by Stanford lecturers, teaching assistants, and other section leaders.

Each week to prepare, I'd review most of the lectures and complete exercises and assignments. This helped me facilitate a discussion and anticipate some of the learners' questions. To help manage time and build community, I prepared a slide deck, icebreaker questions, and discussion topics for breakout rooms.

It was a great experience overall!
