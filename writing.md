### Blogging

I keep a blog here on technical topics to learn them more deeply through the deliberate focus that writing and teaching requires, and to share my knowledge with others.

I like include practical examples from my work experience or side projects.

### This Week In Rails

Andy became a contributing editor ‚úçÔ∏è for [This Week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/), a curated list of outside-facing changes in the Ruby on Rails framework.
