Values help clarify cultural norms on teams. In the face of challenges, these values can help bring positivity, inspiration or motivation. Here are some values that resonate with me.


### Growth Mindset

[Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

- Desire to learn
- Embrace challenges
- Persist in the face of setbacks
- See effort as a path to mastery
- Learn from criticism
- Find lessons and inspiration in success of others

### Continual Learning and Practice

The best way to learn programming is to practice programming. Programming as a career requires continual learning and investment into oneself.

Learning and investment may include breadth and depth. Learning new tecnologies and specialization into preferred, in-demand, or as-needed on the job technologies.

My favorite techniques are to try and create a sample project for a real need I have. Or if I'm learning a particular programming language, use a well-understood domain so that I can focus on the language details.

* Make a Hello World or some samples
  * [Java](https://github.com/andyatkinson/java-stuff), [Kotlin](https://github.com/andyatkinson/kotlin-playground), [Crystal](https://github.com/andyatkinson/crystal-playground), [Micronaut Framework](https://github.com/andyatkinson/micronaut-hello-world), [Docker](https://github.com/andyatkinson/my_web_app), [GraphQL](https://github.com/andyatkinson/graphql-demo), [Elixir and Phoenix](https://github.com/andyatkinson/elixir-getting-started)
* Create sample projects and demos
  * [URL shortener in Go](https://github.com/andyatkinson/gournay)
  * [Rails Best Practices Sample App](https://github.com/andyatkinson/rideshare)
  * [React and Redux frontend](https://github.com/andyatkinson/freezer-frontend)
  * [Go backend](https://github.com/andyatkinson/freezer-backend)
  * [My karaoke list](https://github.com/andyatkinson/singstar)
* Practice coding exercises:
  * [Exercises in C](https://github.com/andyatkinson/exercises)
  * [Recursion examples in Ruby](https://github.com/andyatkinson/recursion-examples)
  * [Hackerrank: andyatkinson](https://www.hackerrank.com/andyatkinson)

I appreciate learning 

I do this in a variety of ways such as creating sample projects, or practicing coding exercises on sites like [HackerRank: andyatkinson](https://www.hackerrank.com/andyatkinson?hr_r=1).

### Rehearsal

Before making a production to code or infrastructure, it is best to rehearse the steps (aka Fail Fast). For example when making production database changes we use techniques like:

* Create a detached database with the same data and hardware
* Use a benchmarking tool like pg_bench to gather some runtime statistics and system load knowledge
* Collect before and after timing information from experimental parameter changes or index changes
* Write steps out as a script and ask for a peer review
* Estimate load and desired outcome
* Write up rollback steps or recovery plans, trying to consider failure scenarios
