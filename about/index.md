#### Recommendations
Andy has 10 recommendations on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/andyatkinson/) and AngelList. One of the recommendations is copied below:

> Andy is a full-stack web and mobile developer, with a strong understanding of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, back-end technologies like Ruby on Rails, and mobile technologies like Objective-C/iOS. He can build things quickly while still writing code that is clear and easy for both novice and experienced developers to understand. He is a great person to have on a team because of his communication skills and patience to mentor and train other developers. I would not hesitate at the opportunity to work with Andy again.
