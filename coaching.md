title: PostgreSQL Coaching and Advisory Sessions
---

## Hi 👋
I’m **Andrew**, and I'd love to help you solve your 🐘 **PostgreSQL** database performance or operational challenges.

I'm offering 55 minute coaching or advisory sessions, where we work together on any Postgres challenges you're facing.

## Who are coaching sessions meant for?
Coaching sessions are meant for anyone interested, but typically they've been used by smaller tech teams facing Postgres challenges, but without a big budget for more broadly-scoped consulting engagements.

Clients are typically individuals or up to two on the client side, usually the CTOs, VP Engs, or similar senior engineering leaders at the company.

What I bring is my knowledge, skills, and experience from [PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails consulting](/consulting) and authoring [High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails](/pgrailsbook), applied to your specific problems.

## Example Topics

- Collecting and interpreting query execution plans
- Designing and optimizing indexes
- Improving PostgreSQL observability
- Improving Database DevOps practices with cohesive, incremental migrations
- Tuning parameters for your specific workload

## Session Logistics

- 55 minutes per session, bookable on Thursdays, on the hour (or book multiple!) between 10AM - 5PM US Central Time (UTC−06:00), online (Google Hangouts)
- Client books sessions on their own, and at the time of booking provides needed company information: Business name, URL, mailing address, contact person name, title, email
- Up to 2 people can attend, recording is fine
- Sessions are prepaid (See below)
- Discount of $100 for 4 sessions with half prepaid

The company information flows into a consulting agreement we'll e-sign describing the services, and time tracking and invoicing on my side.

## We'll be most efficient working together when...

- You're using PostgreSQL observability tools like [PgAnalyze](https://pganalyze.com), [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero), or similar (or are hiring me to help you set those up)
- You're running PostgreSQL hosted on Heroku, AWS, Crunchy Bridge, GCP, or similar
- You can modify PostgreSQL parameters and view `postgresql.log` files (or I can help you do that)

## How much?

$300/session and prepayment is required. For payment options, please read my [Client Payments Guide PDF](client-payments-guide.pdf).

For bigger, and more broadly-scoped engagements, please review my [consulting](/consulting) page. For that offering I can offer a 30 minute discovery call where we'll establish mutual fit and scope items. For coaching I'm not able to offer the discovery call.
