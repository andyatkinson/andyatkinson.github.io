title: PostgreSQL Coaching and Advisory Sessions
---

## Hi 👋
I’m **Andrew**, and I'd love to help you with your 🐘 **PostgreSQL** database operations.

I'm offering 55 minute coaching sessions where we'll work together on any Postgres challenges you're facing.

## Who are coaching sessions meant for?
Coaching sessions are typically booked by smaller tech teams currently facing issues.

These teams are looking to solve problems, and acquire some skills along the way. Clients are usually CTOs, VP Engs, or other hands-on senior engineers.

I'm providing my knowledge, skills, and past experiences in [PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails consulting](/consulting) as a service, applied to your specific problems.

## How will we stay organized?

I'll keep a shared document of notes. We'll use the document for async Q&A before and after our meeting.

Sometimes we'll solve issues within a single session, or other times I'll be hired for multiple sessions to keep working on an issue.

## Example Topics from Past Sessions

- Collecting and interpreting query execution plans
- Designing and optimizing indexes
- Improving PostgreSQL observability
- Improving Database DevOps practices with cohesive, incremental migrations
- Tuning parameters for your specific workload

## Session Logistics

- 55 minute sessions, starting on the hour, Thursdays, 10AM - 5PM Central Time (UTC−06:00)
- Client books any available time below
- Client provides business name, URL, mailing address, a contact person name, title, and email
- We'll meet using Google Hangouts
- Up to 2 people on the client company side can attend, additional fee for extra people
- Sessions must be prepaid.
- Discount of $100 for agreeing to 4 sessions upfront, and prepaying half

## We'll be most efficient working together when...

- You're using PostgreSQL observability tools like [PgAnalyze](https://pganalyze.com), [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero), or similar (or are hiring me to help you set those up)
- You're running PostgreSQL hosted on Heroku, AWS, Crunchy Bridge, GCP, or similar
- You can modify PostgreSQL parameters and view `postgresql.log` files (or I can help you do that)

## How much?

Sessions are $300/session and must be prepaid. For payment information, please read my [Client Payments Guide PDF](client-payments-guide.pdf).

If you're looking for a longer and more comprehensive engagement, please see my [consulting](/consulting) page, and consider booking a 30 minute discovery call. Note that for 55 minute coaching sessions, I'm not able to offer a discovery call.
