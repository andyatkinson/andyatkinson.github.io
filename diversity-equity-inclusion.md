### Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

#### Books

* [The Black Friend: On Being a Better White Person](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Friend-Being-Better-Person/dp/1536217018/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=black+friend&qid=1632932743&sr=8-1)

This book by Author Frederick Joseph is a strong recommendation for anyone, but especially as a white person in the U.S. to better understand privilege, build empathy for the experiences of others, and even how to use privilege to override biases/dysfunction (the mall story).

#### Talks

* TEDx Dr. Beverly Tatum [Is My Skin Brown Because I Drank Chocolate Milk?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_TFaS3KW6s)

#### Events

To help create access opportunities for more folks that do not identify as white males, I've participated in various events as an educator, mentor, or volunteer.

* [Code In Place 2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)
* [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) in Baltimore, MD March 2013
* Rails Bridge in Boston, MA January 2015
* Overnight Website Challenge: Volunteer programmer for non-profit org hackathon event

#### Mentoring
